       "[{'text': '0 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What is considered a business expense on a business trip? ### Response: Taxpayers who travel away from home on business may deduct related   expenses. Expenses must be reasonable   and appropriate; deductions for extravagant expenses are not   allowable. For travel in 2010, the rate for most small   localities in the United States is $46 a day.'},\n",
       " {'text': '1 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Claiming business expenses for a business with no income ### Response: Yes you can claim your business deductions if you are not making any income yet. But first you should decide what structure you want to have for your business. Either a Company structure or a Sole Trader or Partnership. If you choose a Company Structure (which is more expensive to set up) you would claim your deductions but no income. So you would be making a loss, and continue making losses until your income from the business exceed your expenses.'},\n",
       " {'text': \"2 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Transferring money from One business checking to another business checking ### Response: You should have separate files for each of the two businesses. Money into your business from your personal account is probably owner's equity, unless you have something else going on. On the S Corp you should be paying yourself a salary. If you overpay by accident, then you might write a check back to the company from yourpersonal account to correct the mistake.\"},\n",
       " {'text': '3 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Having a separate bank account for business/investing, but not a “business account?” ### Response: Having a separate checking account for the business makes sense. It simplifies documenting your income/expenses. If you deposit dozens of checks every time you go to the bank, the bank will want to move you to a business account. I fund IRAs and 529 plans this way.'},\n",
       " {'text': \"4 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Having a separate bank account for business/investing, but not a “business account?” ### Response: You shouldn't co-mingle business expenses with personal expenses. If you buy a widget, is the widget an expense against business income? Or is it an out of pocket expense for personal consumption? If you are moving money out of the account to your personal account, that speaks to paying yourself.\"},\n",

I was paranoid to give out a checking account number with authorization for a third party to debit it. All this is just to explain that your finances should be arranged to simplify your life.'},\n",
       " {'text': '6 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Having a separate bank account for business/investing, but not a “business account?” ### Response: Someone had deposited a check in to my account then ran my account negative with a \"dupe\" of my debit card. WaMu tied up my account for three months while they investigated. Now one of the accounts contains just enough money (plus a small buffer) to pay my general monthly expenses.'},\n",
       " {'text': \"7 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Business Expense - Car Insurance Deductible For Accident That Occurred During a Business Trip ### Response: As a general rule, you must choose between a mileage deduction or an actual expenses deduction. Exceptions include parking fees and tolls, which can be deducted separately. For most people, the insurance deductible just isn't large enough relative to income to be tax deductible.\"},\n",
       " {'text': \"8 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Starting a new online business ### Response: Most US states have rules that go something like this: You will almost certainly have to pay some registration fees. Depending on how you organize, you may or may not need to file a separate tax return for the business. It could be wise to get professional tax and accounting advice that's tailored to your situation.\"},\n",
       " {'text': \"9 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: “Business day” and “due date” for bills ### Response: When I deposit a check at a bank's drive-in after 4pm Friday, the receipt tells me it will credit as if I deposited on Monday. I don't believe Saturday is a business day either. If a business' computer doesn't adjust their billing to have a weekday due date, they are supposed to accept the payment on the next business day.\"}]"
