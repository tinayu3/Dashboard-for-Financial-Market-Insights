{"text": "1 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Claiming business expenses for a business with no income ### Response: Yes you can claim your business deductions if you are not making any income yet. But first you should decide what structure you want to have for your business. Either a Company structure or a Sole Trader or Partnership. If you choose a Company Structure (which is more expensive to set up) you would claim your deductions but no income. So you would be making a loss, and continue making losses until your income from the business exceed your expenses."},
{"text": "2 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Transferring money from One business checking to another business checking ### Response: You should have separate files for each of the two businesses. Money into your business from your personal account is probably owner's equity, unless you have something else going on. On the S Corp you should be paying yourself a salary. If you overpay by accident, then you might write a check back to the company from yourpersonal account to correct the mistake."},
{"text": "3 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Having a separate bank account for business/investing, but not a “business account?” ### Response: Having a separate checking account for the business makes sense. It simplifies documenting your income/expenses. If you deposit dozens of checks every time you go to the bank, the bank will want to move you to a business account. I fund IRAs and 529 plans this way."},
{"text": "4 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Having a separate bank account for business/investing, but not a “business account?” ### Response: You shouldn't co-mingle business expenses with personal expenses. If you buy a widget, is the widget an expense against business income? Or is it an out of pocket expense for personal consumption? If you are moving money out of the account to your personal account, that speaks to paying yourself."},
{"text": "5 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Having a separate bank account for business/investing, but not a “business account?” ### Response: My wife and I had his/hers/our since before we were married. I was paranoid to give out a checking account number with authorization for a third party to debit it. All this is just to explain that your finances should be arranged to simplify your life."},
{"text": "6 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Having a separate bank account for business/investing, but not a “business account?” ### Response: Someone had deposited a check in to my account then ran my account negative with a \"dupe\" of my debit card. WaMu tied up my account for three months while they investigated. Now one of the accounts contains just enough money (plus a small buffer) to pay my general monthly expenses."},
{"text": "7 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Business Expense - Car Insurance Deductible For Accident That Occurred During a Business Trip ### Response: As a general rule, you must choose between a mileage deduction or an actual expenses deduction. Exceptions include parking fees and tolls, which can be deducted separately. For most people, the insurance deductible just isn't large enough relative to income to be tax deductible."},
{"text": "8 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Starting a new online business ### Response: Most US states have rules that go something like this: You will almost certainly have to pay some registration fees. Depending on how you organize, you may or may not need to file a separate tax return for the business. It could be wise to get professional tax and accounting advice that's tailored to your situation."},
{"text": "9 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: “Business day” and “due date” for bills ### Response: When I deposit a check at a bank's drive-in after 4pm Friday, the receipt tells me it will credit as if I deposited on Monday. I don't believe Saturday is a business day either. If a business' computer doesn't adjust their billing to have a weekday due date, they are supposed to accept the payment on the next business day."},
{"text": "10 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: “Business day” and “due date” for bills ### Response: There are 2 ways for a company to mark a bill as paid. Some systems automatically assign late fees at the start of the day after the due date. For utility bills whose due date and amount can vary slightly from month to month, you're usually better off setting up your payments on the company website."},
{"text": "11 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: “Business day” and “due date” for bills ### Response: It's likely that your bill always shows the 24th as the due date. Their system is programmed to maintain that consistency regardless of the day of the week. If you call them and explain the situation it is likely that they will credit the late charge back to you."},
{"text": "12 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: New business owner - How do taxes work for the business vs individual? ### Response: You have a U.S. LLC with at least two members. If you did not elect some other tax treatment, your LLC will be treated as a partnership by the IRS. You can also elect to be taxed as an S-Corp or a C-Corp instead of a partnership."},
{"text": "13 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to deposit a cheque issued to an associate in my business into my business account? ### Response: Have the check reissued to the proper payee."},
{"text": "14 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to deposit a cheque issued to an associate in my business into my business account? ### Response: You don't even technically have to be there. Just have the associate sign the back and then deposit it. It's called a third party cheque and is perfectly legal. I wouldn't be surprised if it has a longer hold period and you don't get the money if the cheque doesn't clear."},
{"text": "15 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Hobby vs. Business ### Response: Miscellaneous income -- same category used for hobbies."},
{"text": "16 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Hobby vs. Business ### Response: You can list it as other income reported on line 21 of form 1040.

{"text": "17 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Personal checks instead of business ones ### Response: No large business will do that. In their records they have a contract with your company to provide services. If they write you a personal check it won't match with the contract. When the auditors see that they will scream blue murder. Whoever wrote the check will have to prove that you are legitimately the same thing as the company."},

{"text": "19 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Does U.S. tax code call for small business owners to count business purchases as personal income? ### Response: It sounds like something is getting lost in translation here. A business owner should not have to pay personal income tax on business expenses, with the caveat that they are truly business expenses. If many of the purchases are depreciated items instead of deductions, then this could explain why it appears that the business expenses are being taxed."},
{"text": "20 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Does U.S. tax code call for small business owners to count business purchases as personal income? ### Response: Not all expenditures are considered expenses for tax purposes. Good CPAs make a comfortable living untangling this sort of thing. Advice for both of your family members' businesses...consult with a CPA before making big purchases. Can't label business income as profit until the taxes have been paid."},
{"text": "21 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I register a UK business without providing a business address? ### Response: Every company must have a registered office within the UK which is the official legal address of the company. It must be a physical address (i.e. not a PO Box without a physical location) as Companies House will use this address to send correspondence to. Your birth date will also be visible on websites which provide comapnies information."},
{"text": "22 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are 'business fundamentals'? ### Response:  fundamentals include debt, cash flow, supply of and demand for the company's   products, and so forth. For a stock the basic fundamentals are the second column of numbers you see on the google finance summary page. For the company itself it's generally the stuff on the 'financials' link."},
{"text": "23 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can I send a money order from USPS as a business? ### Response: You can fill in whatever you want in the From section of a money order. The price only includes the money order itself. You can hand deliver it yourself if you want. If you want to mail it, you'll have to provide an envelope and a stamp."},
{"text": "24 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Business Investment Loss from prior year ### Response: In the United States, you have three years to file an amended tax return. Did the restaurant fail in 2012? If so, that's probably the year to take the loss. If you need to amend your 2012 return, which you filed in 2013, you should have until 2016 to file this."},
{"text": "25 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Income tax exemptions for small business? ### Response: The IRS defines “startup costs” as deductible capital expenses. These expenses can only be claimed if your research and preparation ends with the formation of a successful business. If you're a sole proprietor for tax purposes, then you'll deduct them on Schedule C of your Form 1040."},
{"text": "26 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: 1 EIN doing business under multiple business names ### Response: If B LLC ceases to exist - it is not going to have it's sales run under A LLC, since there will be no sales to run for a non-existent company. You're confusing a lot of things here. Get a better accountant before you convert to S-Corp."},
{"text": "27 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I estimate business taxes / filing fees for a business that has $0 income? ### Response: Is the business an S-Corp, LLC or Sole Prop? I am going to guess based on the question that it is an LLC that you never closed with the state. I am not aware of any taxes on the mere existence of a business by the IRS. I think you are going to find out that the are no taxes owed to the IRS for this nonexistent activity."},
{"text": "28 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I estimate business taxes / filing fees for a business that has $0 income? ### Response: You need to hire a tax professional and have them sort it out for you properly. Don't do it yourself, you're way past the stage when you could. Be careful of answers like \"you don't need to pay anything\" that are based on nothing of facts."},
{"text": "29 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Would the purchase of a car for a business through the use of a business loan be considered a business expense? ### Response: The IRS has very specific rules for business use of a car. If you use the car 100% for business purposes, you NEVER use it to drive to the grocery store. You can calculate the business use by tracking the percentage of business use versus percentage of personal use."},
{"text": "30 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Deducting last years (undocumented) side business loss ### Response: Lack of documentation reduces your ability to prove that you're entitled to the deduction. You can not deduct it from 2012 taxes, but you can still amend 2011. Keep in mind though that amended returns have higher chance of audit, and a significant business loss on a business that only existed that year is a major red flag."},
{"text": "31 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: 30% share in business ### Response: Keep in mind a good lawyer will have the contract cover the five D's. Its really best to lay these things out ahead of time. I watched, first hand, two friends start a business. When they were broke and struggling the worked very well together. Then the money started rolling in."},
{"text": "32 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: 30% share in business ### Response: Get involved a lawyer and Accountant. Without it you may not be sure what you are getting. What exactly will 30% mean for me? It will mean exactly what gets written in contract. It can mean by current valuation, you get x fixed shares. In future if the directors creates more shares, your % ownership can get diluted."},
{"text": "33 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Claiming business expense from personal credit card ### Response: You should have a separate bank account and charge card for your business.

{"text": "34 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Claiming business expense from personal credit card ### Response: There is no law that requires you to have a separate bank account for your business, or to pay all expenses from a business bank account.

{"text": "35 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Applying for and receiving business credit ### Response: The myth of limited liability companies is that all such vehicles have instant access to credit. Limited liability on a company with few physical assets to underwrite the loan, or with insufficient revenue, will usually mean that the owners will be asked to stand surety on any credit. However, there is a particular form of \"credit\" available to businesses on terms with their clients. It is called factoring."},
{"text": "36 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Applying for and receiving business credit ### Response: Banks will usually look at 2 years worth of tax returns for issuing business credit. If those aren't available, they will look at the personal returns of the owners. Alternative funding such as personal loans from family & friends could be necessary.

{"text": "37 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Using business check to pay at retail ### Response: You can just buy the items personally and then submit an expense report to the company to get reimbursed.

{"text": "39 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do I need a business credit card? ### Response: Business credit can help build a credit score, but remember that businesses gain credit differently from individuals.

Banks will usually base your business credit record on revenue and transactional loads rather than merely on having and holding a credit card."},
{"text": "40 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do I need a business credit card? ### Response: I didn't want to be personally liable for the money that was spent on the business card. As I didn't fancy signing a personal guarantee, the limit was quite low. I would try to avoid mixing business expenditure with personal expenditure so a second credit card might be a good idea."},
{"text": "41 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do I need a business credit card? ### Response: I would suggest at least getting a personal card that you only use for business expenses. The same goes for a checking account, if you have one of those. It makes it easier to defend if you are ever audited, and if you use an accountant or tax preparer."},
{"text": "42 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do I need a business credit card? ### Response: \"I finally got one to separate my business and personal expenses,\" he says. \"It will make accounting at the end of the year a lot easier\" \"It's been a long time coming,\" he adds. \"I'm glad I finally got it.\""},

{"text": "45 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can I pay off my credit card balance to free up available credit? ### Response: If your goal is to improve your credit score I would recommend using the card, staying within your limit and pay it off every month.

Also: you're entitled to a free credit report each year."},
{"text": "46 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can I pay off my credit card balance to free up available credit? ### Response: The typical rules of credit card usage and building your credit, do not apply.

{"text": "52 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is business the only way to become a millionaire? ### Response: Starting a business is one of the ways to become a millionaire, but definitely not the only one.

{"text": "55 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Valuing a small business to invest in  ### Response: It's extremely common for early stage investors to essentially make loans rather than strictly buying shares.

Single owner service companies are difficult because all of the net earnings go to the proprietor."},
{"text": "56 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Starting a large business with a not so large income?  ### Response: A startup has no prior income to use, so it must either raise money through equity or debt.

{"text": "60 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Personal credit card for business expenses ### Response: I have a credit card for my single-member LLC. I prefer it this way because it makes the separation of personal and business expenses very clear.

{"text": "61 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Personal credit card for business expenses ### Response: You should be careful about mingling your personal money and that of the business. There's nothing illegal in what you're doing, but it would make an accountant cringe. The better habit to get into now is keeping that distinct separation between personal and business."},
{"text": "62 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Personal credit card for business expenses ### Response: If you are just starting out, I would say there is no disadvantage to using a personal card for business expenses. In fact, the consumer protections are better on personal cards than on business cards. Issuers expect higher charge volumes, so as your business grows might question a lot of heavy charges."},

{"text": "66 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are the ins/outs of writing equipment purchases off as business expenses in a home based business? ### Response: Keep this rather corny acronym in mind: Business expenses must be CORN.

{"text": "72 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: As a small business owner, should I pay my taxes from my personal or business checking account? ### Response: In virtually all cases LLC's are what's called a pass through entity.

{"text": "76 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should my husband's business pay my business? ### Response: Your husband could deduct this payment as a business expense on Schedule C.

{"text": "77 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why can't online transactions be completed outside of business hours? ### Response: The credit card company won't be able to confirm your transfer until the next business day.

{"text": "83 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Finding a good small business CPA? ### Response: Ask your colleagues!

Using your example your taxable income is $70,000. If your total income is pushing  into a higher tax bracket over 30c tax per $1 earned, it may be worth looking at shifting your business to operate under a company structure."},
{"text": "92 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Taxable income on full-time job + business earnings ### Response: Based on your answer in the comments you and your business are not separate legal entities.

Possible alternative: In my case, the part-time locking is a hobby, not a job."},
{"text": "94 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's “wrong” with taking money from your own business? ### Response: If you own the business entirely yourself, there is nothing terribly wrong with using it for your own purposes as you would any other asset that you own. What is wrong is not keeping accurate records that distinguish between your money and the business's. People tend not to like companies that just shovel all their gains into the owners' pockets."},
{"text": "95 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's “wrong” with taking money from your own business? ### Response: If you are the only owner: then morally there is nothing wrong with this, as long as you make sure that everything is tracked so that you pay the proper taxes from the correct entity. If you live the good life but starve the employees and they realize it, or if you starve the business and the employees realize it; then you might have a problem motivating and retaining employees."},
{"text": "96 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's “wrong” with taking money from your own business? ### Response: It's wrong in several situations:  One, the business owner counts this as a business expense, which it is not, and therefore reduces the company's profit and taxes. If you have to tell your employees that you can't pay their salaries but offer them to admire your brand new Ferrari, that's something I'd consider deeply unethical."},

{"text": "103 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can Health-Releated Services be a Business Expense? ### Response: Since you own your own company, nobody can stop you from charging your personal expenses to your business account. IRS defines deductible business expense as being both: ordinary AND necessary. Meditation is not an ordinary expense (other S-corps do not incur such expense.) It is not a necessary expense either."},
{"text": "104 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to Deduct Family Health Care Premiums Under Side Business ### Response: The \"above the line\" deduction is limited to the net profit from the business.

{"text": "106 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do I need to keep paper records for my business? ### Response: Scanned or electronic copies of invoices should be sufficient as long as they are accurate and you can deliver them during an audit. I find that when handling a large number of documents that paper copies are more easy to handle than electronic ones. In the end you will need to use a system that you feel comfortable with and are able to use effectively."},

You need a business account for that. The bank won't let you because: Differences in required account features. Market segmentation — The bank has consciously undertaken to segment their product offerings in order to maximize their profit."},
{"text": "109 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why do banks require small businesses to open a business bank account instead of a cheaper personal one? ### Response: If you're a sole proprietor - then you could probably open a personal account and just use it, and never tell them that is actually a business. However, depending on your volume of operations, they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions. In the US, some banks offer free, or very low-cost, business accounts for small businesses."},
{"text": "110 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to treat miles driven to the mechanic, gas station, etc when calculating business use of car? ### Response: Common sense would tell us that the cost of driving to make car repairs should be deductible. If you use your car for business, it is a business expense. The same goes for driving a car home from the dealer. You should probably reduce the amount of your deduction by the percentage of personal use of the car."},
{"text": "111 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to treat miles driven to the mechanic, gas station, etc when calculating business use of car? ### Response: IRS Publication 463: Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses Business and personal use. If you use your car for both business and personal purposes,   you must divide your expenses. You can divide your expense   based on the miles driven for each purpose."},
{"text": "112 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to treat miles driven to the mechanic, gas station, etc when calculating business use of car? ### Response: Under most circumstances the distance driven to get your car from the dealership to home, and from home to mechanic and back would be less than 1% of the total miles driven. This is an acceptable rounding error. When refueling, I typically do that on my way to another destination and therefore it's not something I count separately."},
{"text": "113 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: value of guaranteeing a business loan ### Response: How much are you willing to pay for this loan, not counting interest and closing costs? That's what it's worth. See past answers about the risks of co-signing for a realistic view of how much risk your guarantor would be accepting."},
{"text": "114 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: value of guaranteeing a business loan ### Response: The standard goal of valuing anything is to seek the fair price for that thing in the open market. To value your loan guarantee, you would need to figure out what it is actually worth to the business. If you truly can't find an equitable way to value the guarantee, consider whether you understand the true risk of what you are doing."},
{"text": "115 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: value of guaranteeing a business loan ### Response: I always advise against trying to make payments with equity, weather it is for unpaid salary or for guaranteeing a loan such as your case. You are confining the way you and the other co-founders are paid for guaranteeing the loan to capital shares. Trying to determine payments by equity distribution is hard."},
{"text": "116 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: value of guaranteeing a business loan ### Response: You should ask the bank supplying the SBA loan about the % of ownership that is required to personally guarantee the loan. Different banks give different figures, but I believe the last time I heard about this it was 20% or more owners. Make sure you speak with an underwriter since many service people don't know the rules."},
{"text": "117 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Intentions of Deductible Amount for Small Business ### Response: If your sole proprietorship losses exceed all other sources of taxable income, then you have what's called a Net Operating Loss (NOL) You will have the option to \"carry back\" and amend a return you filed in the last 2 years where you owed tax, or you can \"carry forward\" the losses and decrease your taxes in a future year, up to 20 years in the future."},
{"text": "118 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Deducting business expenses paid for by gift card ### Response: You can only deduct an expense that you actually incur. So, if your business purchased the $1000 gift card for $800, you should see a $800 charge appearing on a business CC or bank statement. You would therefore be able to deduct the $800 but not the full $1000 of items that you purchase with it."},
{"text": "119 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Car as business expense, but not because of driving ### Response: To be deductible, a business expense must be both ordinary and necessary. An expense does not have to be indispensable to be considered necessary. Since business don't commonly own cars for the sole purpose of housing $25 computers, you'd have trouble with the \"ordinary\" test."},
{"text": "120 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can a business refuse to take credit cards? ### Response: Businesses are free to decide what payment methods they accept for their goods and services. If a business doesn't accept your credit card, your best recourse is to take your business elsewhere. Note that businesses have good reasons to not accept credit cards.

{"text": "121 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Calculate Estimated Tax on Hobby Business LLC ### Response: For tax purposes its all ordinary income at the end of 2016. If the free lance \"employer\" will withhold fed,state and local tax, then that takes care of your estimated tax. If they can't or won't, you will need to make those estimates and make payments quarterly for the fed and state tax at your projected tax liability."},
{"text": "122 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Calculate Estimated Tax on Hobby Business LLC ### Response: If what you pay in estimated tax (and withholding) this year is at least as much as you owed last year, there's no penalty. Filling out Form 1040SSE will give you a better estimate. I've always done mine this way, dividing last year's tax by 4, since my income is quite variable."},
{"text": "123 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Buying car from rental business without title ### Response: The risk is that they take your money but don't pay the bank. This wouldn't require dishonesty - what if they run into financial trouble? Any money of yours that they have that hasn't gone on to the bank yet might end up paying off other debts instead of yours."},
{"text": "124 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why should I choose a business checking account instead of a personal account? ### Response: Some benefits of having a business checking account (versus a personal checking account) are: The first 3 should be pretty easy to determine if they are important to you. #4 is a little more abstract, though I see you have an LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship. protecting your personal assets may have been one of the driving reasons you formed the LLC in the first place."},
{"text": "125 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to report house used for 100% business? ### Response: The property is a residence, not a business location. The IRS is not going to let you claim 100% of the expenses for the home as a business expense. You run the very real risk of being audited if you try to do what you're proposing."},
{"text": "126 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can the IRS freeze a business Bank account? ### Response: If the business is legally separated and not commingled - they probably cannot. What they can do is put a lien on it (so that you cannot sell the business) and garnish your income. If the corporate veil is pierced (and its not that hard to have it pierced if you're not careful) - then they can treat it as if it is your personal asset."},
{"text": "127 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to record business income tax paid, in QuickBooks? ### Response: Federal income taxes are indeed expenses, they're just not DEDUCTIBLE expenses on your 1120. This is one of the items that will be a book-to-tax difference on Schedule M-1. An S corporation is not likely to be paying federal taxes itself, but would pass the liability through to the members."},
{"text": "128 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Get a loan with low interest rate on small business ### Response: At 7k/month, you have above average household income. The fact that all of your income \"is being washed off somewhere\" is a behavior problem, not a mathematical one. By cutting back, and perhaps working a second job or somehow earning more you could have a down payment for a home in as little as 10 months."},
{"text": "129 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Does revenue equal gross profit for info product business? ### Response: Costs include web-hosting fees, Internet service, computer equipment to do the work.

{"text": "130 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Will unpaid taxes prevent me from getting a business license? ### Response: Your tax debt is to agency X, your license is (mostly) from agency Y. If your business involves agency X then it may be a problem. For example, you cannot get a EA license (IRS Enrolled Agent) if you have unsettled tax debt."},
{"text": "131 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Using cash back rewards from business credit card ### Response: A C-Corp is not a pass-through entity, any applicable taxes would be paid by the Corporation, which is a separate legal entity from yourself. If you use the points to purchase something for yourself, that would constitute \"income\" to you and would be taxable on your personal income tax."},
{"text": "132 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Moving my online only business to the USA? ### Response: You don't need a Visa to create or own US property. Your registered agent will be able to take care of most of this, and your new entity will use the registered agent's address. If you want privacy then you'll want a separate address, which can also be a PO Box."},
{"text": "133 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Moving a personal business to a LLC accounting in California ### Response: You can move money in and out of the business at will, just keep track of every transaction. Create a Capital Contributions account and every time you put money into the business checking account record it as a Capital Contribution. To reimburse yourself for purchases already made, submit an expense report to the company."},
{"text": "134 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What should one look for when opening a business bank account? ### Response: The account process and features were similar to shopping for a personal checking account. There would be fees for falling below a minimum balance, and for wanting a paper statement. Once open for a certain amount of time, you might be able to get credit extended."},
{"text": "135 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What should one look for when opening a business bank account? ### Response: It's a good idea to have a separate business account for your business. The dedicated investment firms (Schwab, Fidelity, etc.) tend to have better options, fees, and features. Just because a specific bank handles your checking account doesn't mean you need to use that bank for everything."},
{"text": "136 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Which r in perpetuity formula to pricing a business? ### Response: The P/E can be viewed as the inverse of the rate of a perpetuity. Since the average is 15, and the E/P of that would be 6.7%, r should be 6% on average. If your business is growing, the growth rate can be incorporated like so."},
{"text": "137 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I deposit a check made out to my business into my personal account? ### Response: You should have a separate business account. Mixing business and personal funds is a bad practice. Shop around, you should be able to find a bank that will let you open a free checking account. You should have minimal activity (e.g. less than 20 of checks per month) and perhaps maintain a small balance."},
{"text": "138 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I deposit a check made out to my business into my personal account? ### Response: When a business asks me to make out a cheque to a person rather than the business name, I take that as a red flag. Frankly it usually means that the person doesn't want the money going through their business account for some reason - probably tax evasion. It's very much in their interests to make the cheque out to the company they did business with."},
{"text": "139 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I deposit a check made out to my business into my personal account? ### Response: Banks are lax about the \"Pay to the Order Of\" line on checks. If you sign the check \"For Deposit Only\", the bank will put it in your account. You may need to set up a \"payable name\" on the account matching your DBA alias."},
{"text": "140 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I deposit a check made out to my business into my personal account? ### Response:  Depending on where you are, you may be able to get away with filing a \"Doing Business As\" document with your local government. There is generally a fee for processing/recording/filing the DBA form. But it's useful for more purposes than just this one."},
{"text": "141 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I deposit a check made out to my business into my personal account? ### Response: Bank of America says the only way to cash a check is to open a business account. To do this, I need a state-issued \"dba\" certificate and an Employer ID Number (EIN) issued by the IRS. Their CHEAPEST business banking account costs $15 / month."},
{"text": "142 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I deposit a check made out to my business into my personal account? ### Response: If you're a sole proprietor there's no reason to have a separate business account. As long as you keep adequate records, as you are one and the same for tax purposes. As a contracted accountant, I don't need to write business checks, and my expenses are minimal."},
{"text": "143 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Filing personal with 1099s versus business s-corp? ### Response: If it was issued to your corporation - then its your corporation's income, not yours. Your corporation and you are two separate legal entities. You will have to file the 1120S, whether you have corporate income or not, it has to be filed each year. If you no longer use the corporation and all the 1099's are issued to you personally, then just dissolve it."},
{"text": "144 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: US Double Taxation - Business Trips and the Foreign Tax Credit ### Response: Most tax treaties have explicit provisions to exclude short trips from the sourcing rules. These would probably not apply to you if you're a US citizen. Your home country should allow credit for the US taxes paid on the US-sourced income. The technicalities depend on your specific country."},
{"text": "145 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can I use my Roth IRA to start a business? ### Response: You may be able to do what you wish, but it must be structured to adhere to specific rules to avoid self dealing. Using IRA funds to invest in the non-traditional assets adds that other layer of risk. So, even if you have the best business idea going, be sure you get proper council on this."},
{"text": "146 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Really have to use business credit card for personal expenses  ### Response: If you aren't ever paying yourself, then you should just pay the company back the $1600 every month. By doing this on a regular basis you are opening the door for piercing the corporate veil. Better to just have the company pay you and then the entire payment is deductible and reduces the profit of the company."},
{"text": "147 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Using credit card points to pay for tax deductible business expenses ### Response: In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable. Most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars; you typically aren't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally."},
{"text": "148 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do Affordable Care Act business requirements apply to “control groups?” ### Response: Common ownership rules are used to determine \"Applicable Large Employer\" status. Only the actual entity missing the mark will owe a penalty, not the entire control group. Yes, it applies to control groups. If I remember correctly common ownership rules were used to decide if an employer is an applicable large employer. For purposes of determining employer status, the term employer also includes a predecessor employer."},
{"text": "149 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: As a contractor, TurboTax Business-and-Home or Basic? ### Response: If you file state tax returns, you shouldn't buy Basic. Ever. Your choice is probably between the \"Premier\" version and the \"Business and Home\" version. The prices have gone down significantly, since when I wrote the article, its cheaper now."},
{"text": "150 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Peer to peer lending business model (i.e. Lending Club) ### Response: The money not yet invested (available/committed to a note but not yet funded) is held in pooled trust account insured by FDIC. Money funded is delivered to the borrower. Lending Club service their notes themselves. This is all answered in the prospectus."},
{"text": "151 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Peer to peer lending business model (i.e. Lending Club) ### Response: The best description of P2P lending process I saw comes from the SEC proceedings. They are very careful about naming things that are happening in the process. Prosper got back to business after this order, but the paper describes succinctly how Prosper worked."},

You'll just need to start with at least 500K. The answer to your question is Forex trading. You can get there by trading the dollar against the euro."},
{"text": "154 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: In what cases can a business refuse to take cash? ### Response: Businesses may refuse cash for services not yet rendered unless prohibited by local law. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. Movie theaters, convenience stores and gas   stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually   notes above $20)"},
{"text": "155 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: In what cases can a business refuse to take cash? ### Response: If your business model doesn't involve a debt that is then settled, you don't have to take cash. For example, in a restaurant where you pay after eating, you can insist on paying cash. But in McDonald's they can refuse your cash at the counter, because you've not received your food yet and so no debt has been incurred."},
{"text": "156 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: In what cases can a business refuse to take cash? ### Response: They don't have to take cash if the transaction hasn't yet happened (not a debt) or if it can be easily undone at no cost to either party - such as a newspaper subscription they can just stop delivering. Trouble arises when it appears there's an ulterior motive for the rule. Chet the plumber hates Muslims. Alice the feed supplier hates the Amish."},
{"text": "157 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: In what cases can a business refuse to take cash? ### Response: Apartment complexes have had a long history of not accepting cash for payment of rent. This eliminates the problem of robbery and strongly reduces the risks of embezzlement. This clause in the Constitution leads some political groups to wish to return to a gold standard."},
{"text": "158 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: In what cases can a business refuse to take cash? ### Response: There is no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Even if the payment is being made to settle a debt or other obligation, the creditor may refuse payment."},
{"text": "159 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Maintaining “Woman Owned Business” while taking on investor ### Response: To qualify as a woman owned business, a woman or group of women must own shares worth 51% of the business. The only way for you to get back to a 51% female ownership situation would be to give a 2.55% ownership stake (from your share) to a wife, sister, mom, girlfriend, or any other woman who you think should benefit from this arrangement."},
{"text": "160 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Maintaining “Woman Owned Business” while taking on investor ### Response: In addition to finding another woman investor, you have an equitable option that is not unreasonable. Ask your partner to buy out 3% worth of shares from you (which then gives her 54%, allowing you to sell 5% to an investor and have it not dilute her below 51%: .54 * .95 = .513)"},
{"text": "161 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Investing/business with other people's money: How does it work? ### Response: Many people deposit money in a bank checking account. The bank then loans some percentage of this money out and keeps the interest. Borrowing money for an investment or business venture is risky. On the other hand, investors expect a share of the profit, not just a fixed interest rate."},

{"text": "183 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why do most banks in Canada charge monthly fee? ### Response: Canada's banking industry is dominated by five chartered banks.

While this situation makes Canada's financial system very stable and efficient, it also permits anti-competitive behavior."},
{"text": "184 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why do most banks in Canada charge monthly fee? ### Response: Lending isn't profitable when interest rates are this low.

{"text": "190 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why do VAT-registered businesses in the EU charge VAT to each other? ### Response: Having a simple sales tax with the type of rates that VAT taxes typically are is unworkable because evasion is too easy. Not doing this would defeat the entire purpose of a VAT. The reason for a VAT rather than a simple Sales Tax is that it's harder to evade."},
{"text": "191 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why do VAT-registered businesses in the EU charge VAT to each other? ### Response: Sales tax in the United States works as you describe. But why can't two companies exchange goods directly without paying VAT? This would make the famous carousel fraud scam impossible and businesses won't have to deal with complicated refunds. If only the end user is charged tax, then fraud is easier than under a VAT."},

That is not the money you would be using to start a business or buy a home."},
{"text": "195 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Allocation between 401K/retirement accounts and taxable investments, as a young adult? ### Response: Retirement accounts are for retirement, and the various early withdrawal penalties are designed to enforce that.

{"text": "206 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can a company have a credit rating better than that of the country where it is located? ### Response: The rating should reflect the borrower's ability to repay its obligations.

Consider consulting with a CPA to ensure that you're doing the proper record keeping."},
{"text": "213 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Transfer $70k from Wells Fargo (US) to my other account at a Credit Union bank ### Response: Your only legal obligation is to pay quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.

{"text": "216 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: I have $100,000 in play money… what to do? ### Response: For any sort of investment you need to understand your risks first. If you're going to put money into the stock or bond market I would get a hold of Graham's \"The Intelligent Investor\" first, or any other solid value investing book.

{"text": "225 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Tax Write-offs and knowing how much I need to spend before the end of the year ### Response: The main issue is that you likely got into business to make money and if you make money consistently you will pay taxes. Reinvesting generally should be a business decision where the main concern is revenue growth. Taxes can be complicated, but for a small LLC shouldn't be that bad."},
{"text": "226 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Loan holder wants a check from the insurance company that I already cashed and used to repair my car ### Response: The reason why the check was made out the owner and the lender is to make sure the repairs were done on the car. For example: you get a six year loan on a new car. In the second year you get hit by another driver. The damage estimate is $1,000, and you decide it doesn't look that bad, so you decide to skip the repair and spend the money on paying off debts."},

Normally, they would keep records, but given that the money center didn't even ask for your signature, \"normal\" probably doesn't apply to them. You can still ask them what records they have, in addition to the other two institutions."},
{"text": "228 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What is the difference between a bond and a debenture? ### Response: Debenture: A type of debt instrument that is not secured by physical asset or collateral.

{"text": "231 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: I started some small businesses but need help figuring out taxes. Should I hire a CPA? ### Response: The only professional designations for people allowed to provide tax advice are Attorney, EA or CPA.

Should I hire a CPA? ### Response: It sounds worthwhile to get a CPA to help you with setting up the books properly and learning to maintain them. What's your own time worth? You can do it yourself if you want to, but it's worth it if you don't."},

What is the penalty for late filing? ### Response: There is no monetary penalty for late filing. However, since I am late I have to do all publication over again which costs me an extra $50.

{"text": "255 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's a Letter of Credit? Are funds held in my bank for the amount in question? ### Response: Letter of credit is commonly used by importers who want to ensure that their product is shipped before paying the exporter.

Are funds held in my bank for the amount in question? ### Response: In a domestic setting, Letters of Credit are often used to build public works needed to support a development.

{"text": "281 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Formation of S-Corp for Gambling Trade ### Response:  Schedule C for professional gamblers is a very accepted thing, nothing extraordinary about it. Since you're gambling yourself, you don't need to worry about liability. If you do, you should probably go LLC route, much cheaper and simpler. The \"reasonable salary\" trick to avoid FICA won't work. Don't even try."},
{"text": "282 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should I file taxes or Incorperate a personal project? ### Response: There's no registering, that's for GST if over a certain threshold.

{"text": "283 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should I file taxes or Incorperate a personal project? ### Response: In the US single owner limited liability entities typically pass the net income through to the owner to be included in their personal tax return.

{"text": "284 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should I file taxes or Incorperate a personal project? ### Response: If you don't make much money, there isn't much tax to save by clever structuring of your affairs. If you do incorporate, you will pay taxes as a corporation, and pay taxes again on your salary paid from that corporation.

{"text": "287 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do Square credit card readers allow for personal use? ### Response: My husband used this device at work in an organization/club that collects dues for fundraisers.

Don't forget the additional expense of business licenses, liability insurances etc."},
{"text": "290 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: If I invest in a company that goes bankrupt, is that a gain or a loss? ### Response: Your bank analogy is flawed in two ways.

{"text": "291 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Getting financial advice: Accountant vs. Investment Adviser vs. Internet/self-taught? ### Response: Do I need an Investment Adviser?

{"text": "293 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Getting financial advice: Accountant vs. Investment Adviser vs. Internet/self-taught? ### Response: I think the OP is getting lost in designations. Does he even have investments?  Does he want to be told which securities to buy? Or is he wanting advice on overall savings, insurance, tax-shelters, retirement planning, mortgages, etc. Which is a different set of skills - the financial advisor skill set."},
{"text": "294 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Privacy preferences on creditworthiness data ### Response: There's no option for you to limit this sharing.

{"text": "296 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Have plenty of cash flow but bad credit ### Response: The Credit Rating Agencies only look at the month-end totals that are on your credit card. The issuing bank will know if you use the credit with the higher frequency, but it probably has little effect on your limit. You could consider calling the issuing bank after two month and try to explain the history a bit and get them to increase the limit."},

{"text": "301 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How does Robinhood stock broker make money? ### Response: As a small business owner (2 businesses), employees cost the most.

{"text": "311 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why are bank transactions not instant? ### Response: If you want your bank to pay $1 to a beneficiary Bob, then the service (no matter how implemented) needs to result in Bob's bank saying to Bob \"Hey, I owe you $1\" This is the main source for the delays in international payments - there are thousands of banks, and most of possible pairs have no legal contact between themselves whatsoever."},
{"text": "312 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why are bank transactions not instant? ### Response: Interbank tranfers ultimately require a transfer of reserves at the central bank. Only the clearing banks and similar (e.g. bacs) have access to rtgs. You can send a chaps payment fairly quickly, but that costs.

{"text": "315 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: When an investor makes money on a short, who loses the money? ### Response: The correct answer to this question is:  the person who the short sells the stock to. Here's why this is the case. Say we have A, who owns the stock and lends it to B, who then sells it short to C. After this the price drops and B buys the stock back from D and returns it to A. The outcome for A is neutral."},
{"text": "316 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: When an investor makes money on a short, who loses the money? ### Response: The lender does charge interest on the borrowed securities. The amount of interest can vary based on a number of factors, such as who is borrowing, how much are they borrowing, and what stock are they trying to borrow. If a company is about to go bankrupt and a lender doesnt have any more shares to lend out, it is unlikely they will purchase more as they stand to lose a lot and gain very little."},
{"text": "317 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: When an investor makes money on a short, who loses the money? ### Response: The lender is not buying the stock back at a lower price. Remember, he already owns it, so he need not buy it again. The person losing is the one from whom the short seller buys back the stock, provided that person bought the stock at higher price. So if B borrowed from A(lender) and sold it to C, and later B purchased it back from C at lower price, then B made profit, C made loss and A made nothing."},

It is just suffocating small business in favour of capitalistic behemoths.

In the long run competition pretty quickly lowers prices as the companies trying to keep high margins and prices get ruthlessly undercut by smaller competitors happy to make a bit less."},
{"text": "325 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: I'm self-employed with my own LLC. How should I pay myself, given my situation? ### Response: You're conflating LLC with Corporation. They're different animals. LLC does not have \"S\" or \"C\" designations, those are just for corporations. If all of your income is coming from self-employment, be prepared for hassles when shopping for a mortgage."},
{"text": "326 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Form 1042-S for foreign resident and owner of trade account ### Response: The 1042-S reflects no income or withholding.

{"text": "327 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Under specific conditions can I write off Spotify or other streaming audio services? ### Response: If you were in the music industry, you might have a case. Depending on the exact job, certain things related to music would be a business expense. I don't see how this would pass an audit as it really is unrelated to the work you do."},
{"text": "328 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: File bankruptcy, consolidate, or other options? ### Response: If your parents' business isn't viable, it would seem that you'd be throwing good money after bad to save it. If they think they're five years away from retirement, then they're kidding themselves. It will be difficult for them to recover from this mess if they're in their late fifties."},
{"text": "329 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: File bankruptcy, consolidate, or other options? ### Response: If your parents can afford to shell out $1,250 a month for 5 years, they would pretty much have the debt paid off. If that payment is too high, maybe you could kick in $5k every few months to knock the principal down. If they think the business can keep puttering along without losing more money, that may be the way to go."},
{"text": "330 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: File bankruptcy, consolidate, or other options? ### Response: A couple of thoughts from someone who's kind of been there... Is the business viable at all? A lot of people do miss the jumping-off point where the should stop throwing good money after bad and just pull the plug on the business. Don't just try to sell it for any price because times are bad if it's self-sustaining and hopefully makes a profit."},
{"text": "331 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: File bankruptcy, consolidate, or other options? ### Response: The way you are talking in your question is as if you have the responsibility and authority to manage their lives.

{"text": "332 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: File bankruptcy, consolidate, or other options? ### Response: Using personal debt to save a company that could have just been dissolved was a very bad move. The best possible end to this scenario for you and your parents would be if your parents could get the debt transferred to the LLC before dissolving it. Bankruptcy is definitely an option."},
{"text": "333 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are companies in California obliged to provide invoices? ### Response: It seems that the service provided to you is not taxable and so there is no obligation under Californian law to provide you with the invoice you need.

{"text": "335 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What amount of money can a corporation spend on entertainment ### Response: There is no simple rule like \"you can/can't spend more/less than $X per person\" Instead there is a reasonableness test.

{"text": "337 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Sole proprietorship or LLC? ### Response: The primary advantage is protection of your personal assets. If your LLC gets sued, they can't take your house/car/dog/wife. There aren't really any financial incentives to be an LLC. Because of the pass-thru taxing structure, you wind up paying the same in taxes."},
{"text": "338 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: why is buying trading-stock from cash not regarded as an expense?  ### Response: For the accounting, it is similar to changing a 100$ bill in five 20$ bills - same value, still assets. Because the stock still has the same value as the money paid for it - you are just exchanging one asset for another."},
{"text": "339 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Does being involved in the management of a corporation make me ineligible for a workshare program? ### Response: Owning a side business would not, by itself, affect your ability to participate in the workshare program.

{"text": "340 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do I only have to pay income tax on capital gains? ### Response: This amount of 10$ will be considered as interest and fully taxable.

{"text": "344 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should I keep copies of my business's invoices for tax records? ### Response: It's always beneficial to have detailed business records.

Whether these records need to be original or electronic might be the topic for another question."},
{"text": "345 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ways to invest my saved money in Germany in a halal way? ### Response: The UK has Islamic banks. I don't know whether Germany has the same or not. Even if there's none in Germany, I assume that with some difficulty you could use banks elsewhere in the EU and even non-Euro-denominated. Their definition of Halal might not precisely match yours, but I'm sure you can satisfy yourself by looking into the details."},
{"text": "346 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ways to invest my saved money in Germany in a halal way? ### Response: You can invest in a couple of Sharia-conform ETFs which are available in Germany and issued by Deutsche Bank.

{"text": "347 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ways to invest my saved money in Germany in a halal way? ### Response: Your definition of halal investment is loose and subject to interpretation. You might get a 10 Year Germany Bund with a fixed coupon rate of 1%, but the real rate of return of this investment is far from fixed. So, from this point of view, everything is \"halal\", because nothing is fixed."},
{"text": "348 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ways to invest my saved money in Germany in a halal way? ### Response: What is not permitted in Islam is the practice of making unethical or immoral monetary loans. Originally, usury meant interest of any kind. A loan may be considered usurious because of excessive or abusive interest rates or other factors. But in case of financial markets, people borrow money to make money and both parties benefits."},
{"text": "349 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: My company owed taxes for many years, An accountant asked me to ignore it and register a new one. Is it a right thing to do? ### Response: I think the first step is to get an accountant whose advice you believe. Your accountant is far better placed to advise you on what sounds like a fairly complicated, fairly high stakes corporate arrangement than the internet. I would go back to the accountant and get him to explain in writing what his specific advice is. If you still don't like it absolutely get a second opinion."},

{"text": "354 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What happens to your spouse's sole proprietorship if they die? ### Response: The simplest path forward would be to convert the business to a partnership where both spouses are owners, and to write a clause into the partnership agreement stipulating what happens upon death of a partner. Such an approach really should be done with a lawyer to make sure that it's all legally sound."},
{"text": "355 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are banks really making less profit when interest rates are low?  ### Response: As long as the interest rate charged on loans doesn't decline faster than the interest rates received on deposit accounts, banks can continue to operate normally. Banks may be able to acquire the same net interest margin with lower risk. However new research from a federal agency shows that net interest margins (NIMs) get worse during low-rate environments."},
{"text": "356 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are banks really making less profit when interest rates are low?  ### Response: Banks are making less profit from the lending business when interest rates are historically low. Most of the banks loans are refinanced from nice high rates to current market low interest rates.

{"text": "357 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are banks really making less profit when interest rates are low?  ### Response: Banks make less profit when \"long\" rates are low compared to \"short\" rates.

{"text": "358 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market? ### Response: Stock price is an indicator about the health of the company.

{"text": "361 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market? ### Response: There is a strong chance that people running the company also have stock, so it personally benefits them to create higher prices. They are obligated by the rules of the exchanges they are listed with. Finally, maybe they don't care about the prices directly, but by being a good company with a good product or service, they are desirable."},
{"text": "362 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market? ### Response: The corporate charter describes why the company exists.

The most significant reason is that if they neglect the company's stock value they will lose their jobs as a result. The board's job is to make sure the company is valued by its stockholders."},
{"text": "365 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market? ### Response: A public company is owned by its share holders, and share holders would care about the price of the stock they are owning. The company would also care, because if the price go down too much, share holders become angry and may vote to oust the company's management."},
{"text": "366 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market? ### Response: Shares are used as a currency during acquisitions, if company shares are overpriced that means they can buy another company on the cheap. Overpriced shares: Cheaper to raise new capital through secondary share offerings or debt using shares as a security. Fends off hostile take overs, since the company is too dear."},
{"text": "367 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would a company care about the price of its own shares in the stock market? ### Response:  share price is the most common method of valuating the company.

In 2016 10-k filing Schwab posted $1.8B in net earnings, 10 million client accounts with a total of $2.78T in client assets. A couple grand in ATM fees over several years is a rounding error."},
{"text": "378 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can Schwab afford to refund all my ATM fees? ### Response: Like a lot of businesses, they win on the averages, which means lucrative customers subsidize the money-losers.

{"text": "401 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is issuer's bank allowed to charge fee when cashing check? ### Response: You are going to a bank where you are not a customer and requesting a transaction that requires a teller. If you cash the check by going through your bank, the issuer's bank only handles it as a non-teller transaction."},
{"text": "402 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to invest 10k dollars, at the age of 23? ### Response: An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest, as Ben Franklin said. Sometimes opportunities will knock on your door and you can take advantage, other times you have to create that door to allow opportunities to knock. What I suggest is to start investing just to get into the habit of it, not so much for the returns."},
{"text": "403 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Employer options when setting up 401k for employees ### Response:  setup the 401K in A such that any employee can contribute 100% of their salary. Then continue to move dividends to Company A, and continue the SEP in B. This way if you are below age 50, you can contribute 54K + 18K (IRA limit) + 5500 (ROTH income dependent) to a qualified plan."},
{"text": "404 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Investment time horizon: When is it acceptable to withdraw money from investments? ### Response: Stocks are one of the higher-risk investment classes out there. If you know you'll definitely have to withdraw $50k (or any large chunk) of it within just a few years, it's possible that a great long-term vehicle like stocks, could rob you of money on a shorter time horizon."},
{"text": "405 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Investment time horizon: When is it acceptable to withdraw money from investments? ### Response: Invest the 300K in safe liquid investments then move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts. Depending on which company you work for that could include 401K (Regular or Roth), deductible IRA, Roth IRA.

{"text": "406 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Tax rules for United States citizens living in the US but being paid from outside the US ### Response: You can and are supposed to report self-employment income on Schedule C (or C-EZ if eligible, which a programmer likely is) If this income is large enough your tax on it will be more than $1000, you may need to make quarterly estimated payments. A single-member LLC or 'S' corp is usually disregarded for tax purposes."},
{"text": "407 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Estimated Taxes after surge in income ### Response: If you had literally zero income during the first quarter, you won't be expected to make an estimated tax payment for that quarter. You can potentially use the Annualized Income Installment method, which allows you to compute the tax due for each quarter based on income actually earned up to that point."},
{"text": "408 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Estimated Taxes after surge in income ### Response: Use the instructions for Form 2210 and in particular \"Schedule AI -- Annualized Income Installment Method,\" which corrects the penalty for highly variable income. Using this form you will likely be able to avoid the penalty, but it is hard to know for sure."},
{"text": "409 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to reconcile a credit card that has an ongoing billing dispute? ### Response: You could make an entry for the disputed charge as if you were going to lose the dispute, and a second entry that reverses the charge. You could then reconcile the account by including the first charge in the reconciliation and excluding the reversal until the issue has been resolved."},
{"text": "410 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to reconcile a credit card that has an ongoing billing dispute? ### Response: What I would prefer is top open a new category charges under dispute and park the amount there. It can be made as an account as well in place of a income or expenses category. This way your account will reconcile and also you will be able to track the disputes."},
{"text": "411 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Income tax on international income with money not deposited in India ### Response: If the work is done in India, then the income arising out of it, is taxable when received by you, and not when it come into India. If the work was done in Indian, the income is tax-free when it is received in India."},
{"text": "412 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Income tax on international income with money not deposited in India ### Response: In the very first year, you should have 182 days outside India. Although you may be starting a consultancy abroad, if you do any services in India, there will be withholding tax. Whatever money you repatriate is not taxable in India."},
{"text": "413 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to represent “out of pocket” purchases in general ledger journal entry? ### Response: You're lending the money to your business by paying for it directly. The company accounts must reflect a credit (the amount you lend to it) and a debit (what it then puts that loan towards) It's fairly normal for a small(ish) owner-driven company to reflect a large loan-account."},
{"text": "414 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to represent “out of pocket” purchases in general ledger journal entry? ### Response: Each expense actually could be a total if you don´t want to itemise, to save time if you totaled them on a paper. The paper is essentually an invoice. You want the company to settle at any time the balce is totaled for your name in the company books and the company name in your books."},
{"text": "415 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can this check still be honored? [duplicate] ### Response: The check was issued and never cashed, which is not all that unusual for companies in business for a long time. You could talk to them, but it's highly doubtful any bank would honor a check from 26 years ago. Most checks in the U.S. are only valid for 180 days."},
{"text": "416 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What does the phrase “To make your first million” mean? ### Response: \"Net Worth\" reached 1M where \"net worth\" = assets - liabilities. I'd interpret it as \" net worth\" reaching 1M. \"Net worth\" is assets minus liabilities, or assets plus liabilities. It's the difference between a company's assets and its liabilities."},
{"text": "417 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What does the phrase “To make your first million” mean? ### Response: I've not heard it used in any way other than one's net worth reaching a million. No 30-year-old lawyer brags that his cumulative income just passed $1M because he may not have saved a dime of it."},
{"text": "418 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What does the phrase “To make your first million” mean? ### Response: When people are crowing about their achievements, they often take liberties with those achievements. Vitalik's interpretation -- net worth, is probably what you would naturally come to mind. But when someone is bragging, that could mean anything -- $1M of total revenue."},
{"text": "419 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is it ok to use a check without a pre-printed check number? ### Response: The check numbers were put in as a fraud prevention mechanism to ensure that one check was only presented once and that it was issued to a particular account. For the clearing house, only the routing number and the check amount is important. If your volume of check issuing increases, they may start putting in a check number to better track."},
{"text": "420 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is it ok to use a check without a pre-printed check number? ### Response: There's a perception that people using starter checks are more likely to bounce or otherwise be troublesome. When more payments were made with checks, some vendors would not accept checks with low numbers. Checks are very cheap to get printed these days, save yourself some trouble and get some printed."},
{"text": "421 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would selling off some stores improve a company's value? ### Response: If a store is actually a net-loss, and anybody is willing to buy it, it may well make sense to sell it. Investors seem to go in cycles, like can like well-diversified companies that are resilient to a market downturn in one sector."},
{"text": "422 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would selling off some stores improve a company's value? ### Response: I don't think a retail location needs to be losing money to be a candidate for sale. Many large companies have multiple lines of business. It may make sense to sell assets in an under-performing business in order to free up the capital tied up by that business."},
{"text": "423 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why would selling off some stores improve a company's value? ### Response: Maybe the location isn't yet, but will soon become a new loss. There is the possibility that the land the location occupies is worth more sold to the new big box retailer than it will be in the next 10 years. In some cases, companies want to have a ton of cash on hand, or would sell assets to pay off debt."},
{"text": "424 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How important is reconciling accounts for a small LLC (Quickbooks)? ### Response: I would suggest opening a new account (credit card and bank) for just your business. This protects you in multiple ways, but is no bigger burden for you other than carrying another card in your wallet. Then you can download the transactions from your website and reconciling is a cinch."},
{"text": "425 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Get the maximum interest rate from a bank on short term holdings ### Response: You can open Savings Bank Account with some Banks that offer better interest rate. Note there would be restriction on number of withdrawals in quarter. There are better interest rates if you lock in for 90+ days. The other option to explore is to open a Demat / Brokrage account and invest in liquid funds."},
{"text": "426 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Following an investment guru a good idea? ### Response: The best answer here is \"maybe, but probably not\". Its not a bad idea to watch other investors especially those who can move markets. But do your own research on an investment first. Your sole reason for investing should not be \"Warren did it\"."},
{"text": "427 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Following an investment guru a good idea? ### Response: The buys from your favorite investors can be taken as strong signals. But you should never buy any stock blindly just because someone else bought it. Be sure do your due diligence before the purchase. The most important question is not what they bought, but why they bought it and how much."},
{"text": "428 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: If a stock is selling for less than book value, is the company headed for bankruptcy? ### Response: The efficient market hypothesis would say that this means that the market perceives the present value of all future earning as negative. It might also mean that future \"real\" earnings \"ie actual profit and loss on sales\" are going to be negative. This would mean bankruptcy is more likely."},
{"text": "429 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: If a stock is selling for less than book value, is the company headed for bankruptcy? ### Response: An answer can be found in my book, \"A Modern Approach to Graham and Dodd Investing,\" p. 89. A company with a stock trading below book value is believed to be \"impaired,\" perhaps because assets are overstated. Depending on the situation, it may or may not be a bankruptcy candidate."},
{"text": "430 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do I get bill collectors who call about people I know to stop calling me? ### Response: Look at section 805 and 805 about how they may contact you and what they are and aren't allowed to do. You can simply send a Certified Mail, Return Receipt (CMRR) letter. Then you can either put return to sender on the letters (it costs them money) or open them and delete anything you don't need."},
{"text": "431 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do I get bill collectors who call about people I know to stop calling me? ### Response: A bill collector repeatedly calls friends or family to track down a debtor. Here are two suggestions: Perhaps, a small fib: \"The creep owes me money too! Grrr! Let me know when you find him!\" Then have the phone company block the bill collector's number from calling you."},
{"text": "432 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do I get bill collectors who call about people I know to stop calling me? ### Response: The best thing to do to telemarketers is to put them on hold. If they really won't stop calling you, just waste their time. Do it every time they call and soon they'll get the idea that you're a waste of time."},
{"text": "433 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do I get bill collectors who call about people I know to stop calling me? ### Response: I had a similar situation, except the debtor had no connection to us whatsoever, other than holding our phone number. We tried going through channels to deal with it, and had no success. At the end of the day, I was very abusive to the people calling, and forwarded the number to a very irritating destination."},
{"text": "434 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is there a reason to buy a 0% yield bond? ### Response: 0% bonds are desirable for some individuals. It depends on your situation. Capital gains are taxed at a more favourable rate then income. This is especially true when holding these investments in corporations. A similar investment paying interest would be taxed as INCOME, and smaller portion of capital gains."},
{"text": "435 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is there a reason to buy a 0% yield bond? ### Response: As an individual you're likely better off in a low-yield cash account. There are a number of reasons that institutions buy these bonds. By contrast, there would be a reason to hold a non-zero bond rather than an alternative."},
{"text": "436 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are the implications of lending money to my sole member S-corp? ### Response: You can make a capital contribution, not a loan. It's not a taxable event, no interest, and you can take a distribution later. If you use software like Quickbooks, make use of unique accounts for tracking the contribution."},
{"text": "437 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are you allowed to have both a 401(k) and a SIMPLE IRA? If so, what about limits? ### Response: You can't max out both. You could theoretically max out the SIMPLE IRA ($11,500) and then contribute $4,000 to your 401k. But your total can't exceed the 401k limit of $16,500. You should probably run the numbers, factoring in the employer match."},
{"text": "438 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - Service vs. Product? ### Response: Your tax home is the place where you are permanently or indefinitely engaged to work as an employee or self-employed individual. Having a \"tax home\" in a given location does not necessarily mean that the given location is your residence or domicile for tax purposes. The location of your tax home often depends on whether your assignment is temporary or indefinite."},
{"text": "439 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - Service vs. Product? ### Response: If you have been paying US income tax on this while living in the US, nothing is going to change here. Passive income earned abroad (dividends, interest) also do not fall under this exemption. The purpose of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion is to make it easy for expats who work abroad to avoid double income taxation."},
{"text": "440 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - Service vs. Product? ### Response: Yes, you qualify based on the residence test. You perform your work outside the US. You gather business data in a foreign country. The income is excluded. Fear tactics posted above, likely by IRS agents. The IRS has not commented on this article."},

{"text": "442 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What is a good open source Windows finance software ### Response: You really shouldn't be using class tracking to keep business and personal operations separate. I'm pretty sure the IRS and courts frown upon this, and you're probably risking losing any limited liability you may have. For keeping separate parts of the business separate, like say stores in a franchise, one approach would be subaccounts."},
{"text": "443 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to find out if a company has purchased government (or other) bonds? ### Response: It is safe to assume that at least some portion of the cash/cash equivalents will be in liquid bonds. This is in the balance sheet, but the info is not usually that detailed. You may find more specific details in the company SEC filings (annual reports etc)."},
{"text": "444 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should a retail trader bother about reading SEC filings ### Response: There are many different kinds of SEC filings with different purposes. One example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is Form 4. SEC filings are made by individual companies, so it doesn't generally help you to read them unless you're going to take action related to an individual company."},
{"text": "445 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should a retail trader bother about reading SEC filings ### Response: I use 10-K and 10-Qs to understand to read the disclosed risk factors related to a business. I like seeing how many authorized shares there are or if there are plans to issue more. A lot of companies are able to act they way they do because people do not read."},
{"text": "446 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What should I be aware of when renting a home to a corporation instead of an individual? ### Response: All background checks and references should be with regards to the actual renter - the corporation. You should be cautious as it is not so easy to dissolve an individual. So you may end up with a tenant who doesn't pay and doesn't have to pay because the corporation no longer exists."},
{"text": "447 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Quickbooks custom field for computing a value ### Response: Custom fields are limited to non-calculated values. To do this you will need an add-on. I would reccomend CCRQInvoice, but only because its the only one I've tried and it worked."},
{"text": "448 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are individual allowed to use accrual based accounting for federal income tax? ### Response: Once you chose the method (on your first tax return), you cannot change it without the IRS approval. For individuals, I can't think of any reason why would accrual basis be better than cash, or why would an individual use a fiscal year other than the calendar year."},
{"text": "449 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: If I take a loss when I sell my car, can I claim a capital loss deduction on my income tax return? ### Response: Cars are personal use property. While you'd need to pay tax if you realized a capital gain on the sale of your car, you generally can't deduct any loss arising from the sale. This is because if a property depreciates through personal use, the resulting loss on its disposition is a personal expense."},
{"text": "450 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: After a stock dividend, how do you calculate holding periods for capital gains taxes? ### Response: Stock acquired through a (non-taxable) stock dividend has the same holding period as the stock on which the dividend was paid.

{"text": "451 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to know if I can have NOL (U.S. tax)? ### Response: NOL is Net Operating Loss. Individuals most definitely can have NOL. This is covered in the IRS publication 536. Capital loss occurs when the total amount of your capital gains reported on Schedule D is negative. Not all expenses and deductions that you usually put on your tax return are allowed for NOL calculation."},
{"text": "452 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What does “Income generated in the U.S.” mean? ### Response: It means you must pay federal (and possibly state) tax on any income you produce in America -- including Internet and mail-order sales. Tax treaties may keep you from having to pay tax on it again in your own country, or may not."},

How does the receipt to customer look?"},
{"text": "455 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is there a dollar amount that, when adding Massachusetts Sales Tax, precisely equals $200? ### Response: Your state may want your pre-tax sales total for the reporting period. To get that, total up your gross sales that you collected, and divide by (1 + tax rate). Just like DJClayworth says, except do it on total sales instead of per-item."},
{"text": "456 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is there a dollar amount that, when adding Massachusetts Sales Tax, precisely equals $200? ### Response: X=200/1.0625 = $188.24 plus tax comes to $200.01. Yes, it's a simple calculation. I would just eat the extra $0.01, however. (x+0.06 25x)=200 or x=200-1-0625x=200."},
{"text": "457 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do the activities of my LLC need to be limited to a particular field? ### Response: No. When you file your Articles of Organization, simply state that your business will operate under the law.

Perhaps \"monetary transaction basis\" might have been a better name."},
{"text": "460 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Deductible expenses paid with credit card: In which tax year would they fall? ### Response: The courts have ruled that credit cards balances are considered debt. It's treated the same way as if you went to the bank, got a loan, and used cash or a check to purchase the items. On your accounting books, you would debit the expense account and credit the credit card liability account."},
{"text": "461 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Deductible expenses paid with credit card: In which tax year would they fall? ### Response:  deduction against expenses are claimed in the year in which expenses has been incurred. It has no relationship with when it is paid. For example, we may buy on credit does not mean that they will be allowed in the period in which it's paid. This is against the fundamental accounting principles."},

{"text": "467 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Expensive agenda book/organizer. Office expense or fixed asset? ### Response: If your business pays taxes, it is in your best interest to expense it. Even if you don't pay taxes, setting your capitalization policy low enough to capitalize an office organizer (even a nice one) will give you headaches when your business grows larger."},
{"text": "468 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Expensive agenda book/organizer. Office expense or fixed asset? ### Response: I cannot imagine an organizer being worth enough to consider depreciating the expense over a period of time greater than one year. Once you write in an organizer, it's pretty much worthless to anyone else. Talk to your accountant if you'd like, but I cannot see how you would classify a fancy organizer as a fixed asset."},
{"text": "469 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are ACH transfers between individuals possible? ### Response: Many banks offer such a service. You log in to your account on the bank's website, enter the recipient's routing and account numbers, and off you go. You could ask your bank whether they offer this. If not, you could change banks to one that does."},

You are a cash-basis taxpayer, so the transactions that happen in each tax year are based on the cash paid and cash received in that year. At this point, you have two months to look for ways to shift expenses into next year or being income into this year, both of which help offset this loss."},

{"text": "474 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Canadian accepting money electronically from Americans ### Response: The problem with mailed cheques is that they take time to deliver, and time to clear.

{"text": "476 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Changing Mailing Adress ### Response: An address change with an immediate request for a replacement debit card smells very fishy - this what a hacker / thief would do to get your money. Calling seems to be the better approach, as you can verify your identity further. If you want to do it online, there is some risk that the update is delayed."},
{"text": "477 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Self-directed RRSP into mortgage investment ### Response: The Globe and Mail has an interesting article on what you can do with your RRSPs. I'd be very cautious about loaning money to someone else for a second mortgage using my RRSP. Second mortgages are inherently risky, so this is a very speculative investment."},

Is this normal? ### Response: It's not abnormal for a company that is as young as yours seems to be. For now, you're \"entitled\" to pay yourself a draw or a salary.

{"text": "486 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Accidentally opened a year term CD account, then realized I need the money sooner. What to do? ### Response: In my experience, the only penalty to breaking a CD is to lose a certain amount of accumulated interest. Your principal investment will be fine. A few days of interest is nothing. Closing the CD is the best way to protect your money."},
{"text": "487 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Taxation of shares ### Response: If you sell your shares for more than their value at the time you received them then you will be liable for capital gains tax.

{"text": "489 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Where should I invest to hedge against the stock market going down? ### Response: If you believe the stock market will be down 20-30% in the next few months, sell your stock holdings, buy a protective put option.

{"text": "490 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Where should I invest to hedge against the stock market going down? ### Response: A short sale has no theoretical limit to the amount of money you can lose. If you were certain you would probably do best by short selling an ETF that tracked the index for the market you think was about to tank.

{"text": "492 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Where should I invest to hedge against the stock market going down? ### Response: Put Options are less risky than shorting, and have similar upsides.

{"text": "493 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Where should I invest to hedge against the stock market going down? ### Response: There are multiple ETFs which inversely track the common indices, though many of these are leveraged.

{"text": "503 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What tax rules apply to selling of digital goods, specifically in-game currencies? ### Response:  legally defining in-game assets is exceptionally difficult from a legal/taxation stand point.

These areas overlapped in areas like the production of financial statements."},
{"text": "507 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to register LLC in the US from India? [duplicate] ### Response: Wyoming is a good state for this.

{"text": "516 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What prevents interest rates from rising? ### Response: Interest rates are market driven. They tend to be based on the prime rate set by the federal reserve bank. No law stipulates that rates cannot rise or fall. They will rise and fall as lenders see necessary to use their capital.

{"text": "517 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What prevents interest rates from rising? ### Response: To protect yourself from an increase in interest rates get a fixed rate loan. The loan terms: interest rate, number of payments, monthly payments will be fixed. If rate for the rest of the market drops during the period of the loan, you may be able to refinance the loan.

{"text": "526 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can dividends be exploited? ### Response: The dividend was announced on July 24th, and is given to shareholders of record on August 13th. Why would I buy shares from you at full price one day after the dividend is paid, if I will have to wait for the next dividend? You are way behind the curve."},
{"text": "527 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can dividends be exploited? ### Response: An ex-dividend is the day that allows you to get a dividend if you own the stock.

A lot of people assume it's the 3rd option always. But if the person is reputable, it's most likely 1 or 2. You can't run a business doing option 3 for long without getting a reputation."},

From there you can assert that you will purchase only when you are ready."},
{"text": "548 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Buying from an aggressive salesperson ### Response: My advice is to quit worrying about the salesman's tactics.

{"text": "552 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Buying from an aggressive salesperson ### Response: You could be slightly worried because he gave you exceptionally good deals for both instruments. Maybe he simply prices all items way up to be able to give a great discount. You can't ever know; the actual price you pay in the end is what counts. If I expect in advance (or if I notice during the negotiation) that I am put under pressure in this way, I usually try to do exactly the same, in reverse."},
{"text": "553 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Buying from an aggressive salesperson ### Response: Don't sell your personal needs short.

I suggest talking to a EA/CPA licensed in NY and NJ to try and see what you can do to avoid being resident in both."},
{"text": "560 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: 183 day rule in conjunction with expatriate ### Response: There's no \"183 days\" rule. As a US citizen you must pay taxes on all your income. Where you live is irrelevant. There's no '183 days' rule. It's just a way to get around the tax code."},
{"text": "561 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Would I need to keep track of 1099s? ### Response: You have to file and issue each one of them a 1099 if you are paying them $600 or more for the year.

{"text": "562 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Receiving important daily wires from abroad? ### Response: Bank would flag this off to regulators and questions would be asked. If you are doing a Legitimate business, its not an issue. Maintain a proper record of the transaction and pay your taxes. As funds are large 80 K a month, it makes sense to seek to advice of a Laywer and CA."},
{"text": "563 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Reporting software subscriptions ### Response: You should be able to put it in the same area where you put all your other business expenses. If you're a sole proprietor - that would be Schedule C. Generally prepaid services should be capitalized over the period prepaid. But if it is up to a year - you can just expense them."},
{"text": "564 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can you lease a secondary residential apartment for a job in NYC, and declare it as expense in tax return? ### Response: Housing can't be considered a business expense unless taken at your employer's explicit direction.

{"text": "565 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Does the low CAD positively or negatively impact Canadian Investors? ### Response: If you buy US stocks when the CAD is high you will make a currency gain on top of any profit or loss from the stock investments. If you are just starting out you may be better off investing in your own country to avoid any currency risk adding to your stock market risk."},
{"text": "566 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Does the low CAD positively or negatively impact Canadian Investors? ### Response: At the time of writing, the Canadian dollar is worth roughly $0.75 U.S. It's not possible for you to accurately predict what it'll be worth in, say, ten years.

{"text": "567 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Does the low CAD positively or negatively impact Canadian Investors? ### Response: When you want to invest in an asset denominated by a foreign currency, your investment is going to have some currency risk to it. You need to worry not just about what happens to your own currency, but also the foreign currency. If you want a foreign investment to be currency neutral, you just make the opposite currency trade."},
{"text": "568 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Credit and Debit  ### Response: There are three parts to the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity.

{"text": "569 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Credit and Debit  ### Response: In view of business, we have to book the entries. Business view, owner and business are different. When capital is invested in business by owner, in future business has to repay it. That's why, capital always credit. When we come about  bank (business prospective) - cash, bank, fd are like assets which can help in the business."},
{"text": "570 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: 1099 for settlement what about lawyer fees? ### Response: Compensatory damages are generally not taxable at all. You report it as an expense against the 1099 income when you do your taxes. You will only be taxed on the amount after the lawyers fees.

{"text": "571 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Individual Client or Customer fining or charging a Company a penalty fee ### Response: What keeps an individual from being able to charge, fine or penalize a Business? If it could be accomplished, but at a high cost, let's assume it's based on principal and not monetary gain. You are of course welcome to send your doctor a letter stating that you would like $50 to make up for your two hour wait last time around."},
{"text": "572 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Tax intricacies of MLP in a Roth IRA ### Response: Having MLP shares in your IRA will not cause you any tax hassles.

{"text": "575 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Mortgage implications if I were to quit my job shortly after being approved? ### Response: In the U.S. there would be one last check as a part of closing. Waiting until after closing would also protect you from some hiccup that causes a delay in closing, thus requiring the need to reapply for the loan."},
{"text": "576 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can my U.S. company do work for a foreign company and get wire transfers to my personal account? ### Response: If you plan on being a company then set up the appropriate structure for it.

{"text": "581 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Cost is (maybe) part of basis for two assets ### Response: For accounting purposes, consider the costs of acquisition as part of the cost of the asset as opposed to expensing. This will be important to consider if you need to amortise the asset for reporting or tax purposes. The basis for dividing the cost should be done at appraised prices."},
{"text": "582 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Online tool to connect to my bank account and tell me what I spend in different categories?  ### Response: I'm not convinced this is completely possible without additional data. I keep running into things like \"was this hardware store purchase for home repair, hobby tools and supplies, cookware, ...\" Ditto for department stores, ditto for cash purchases which appear only as an ATM withdrawal."},

It automatically downloads all my bank and credit card activity and has excellent reporting options. It's not free, but it's very much not free. I use it to keep track of all my money.

{"text": "588 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What would happen if the Euro currency went bust? ### Response: Each country would have to go back to its own currency, or the rich countries would just kick the poor ones out of the EU. It would be bad for the poor countries, and the global economy would suffer, but it really wouldn't be a big deal."},
{"text": "589 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What would happen if the Euro currency went bust? ### Response: Euro have problems, but they are rather solvable, unlike dollar situation. Even if something wrong would happen - countries would return to their national currencies. This does not means that EuroUnion would be destroyed - some countries live in EU without Euro and they are just fine."},
{"text": "590 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What would happen if the Euro currency went bust? ### Response: If the Euro went bust then it would be the 12th government currency to go belly up in Europe (according to this website) Europe holds the record for most failed currencies. Some countries may switch to a foreign currency (i.e. the US dollar if it is still around)"},
{"text": "591 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What would happen if the Euro currency went bust? ### Response: I'd have anything you would need for maybe 3-6 months stored up: food, fuel, toiletries, other incidentals. What might replace the currency after the Euro collapses will be the least of your concerns when it does collapse."},
{"text": "592 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What would happen if the Euro currency went bust? ### Response: Krugman: Greek euro exit, very possibly next month. Huge withdrawals from Spanish and Italian banks, as depositors try to move their money to Germany. Germany has a choice. Accept huge indirect public claims on Italy   and Spain, plus a drastic revision of strategy."},
{"text": "593 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What would happen if the Euro currency went bust? ### Response: The real reason you hear those rumors is that America (along with minor partners like the British Sterling) want to bring down the Euro for medium-term benefit. The result would be catastrophic. The almost-reserve currency would collapse which would produce a medium sized depression."},
{"text": "594 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How does LLC ownership work in relation to U.S. tax law? ### Response: It really depends. If it is offered as compensation (ie in leiu of, or in addition to salary or cash bonus) then it would be reportable income. If sold later for a profit then that would be taxable as gains. Any discount could be considered income but there are some goofy rules surrounding this."},
{"text": "595 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: S Corp with Straddles Income ### Response: Having 25% of passive income in 3 consecutive years will invalidate your S-Corp status and you'll revert to C-Corp. Can I deduct normal business expenses from the straddles (which are   taxed as short term capital gains) profit? I don't believe you can."},
{"text": "596 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Executor of will  ### Response: I strongly doubt that being executor will make the assets of the estate vulnerable to a suit against him personally. Unless he has commingled assets and treated estate assets as his own, the legal separation should be quite strong. If the business was organized as an LLP or LLC, his personal assets should be pretty safe."},
{"text": "597 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Executor of will  ### Response: The creditors will not be able to go after his father's estate (assuming the father had nothing to do with the business) At that point, any money or assets that your husband inherits will be fair game, as they are now your husband's money and assets."},
{"text": "598 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Online streaming video/audio financial/stock programs ### Response: The CNBC site is littered with videos.

{"text": "600 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What does this statement regarding put options mean? ### Response: \"16 puts on Cisco at 71 cents\", means John comes to Jim and says, i'll give you 71 cent now, if you allow me to sell one share of Cisco to you at $16 at some point in the future ( on expiration date)  NYT quote says 1000 puts that means 1000 contracts - he bought a right to sell 100,000 shares of Cisco."},
{"text": "601 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Prepaid Rent (Accrual Based Accounting) ### Response: Your account entries are generally correct, but do note that the last transaction is a mixture of the balance sheet and income statement. If Quickbooks doesn't do this automatically then the expense must be manually removed from the balance sheets. The expense should be recognized when the prepaid rent is extinguished when consumed by the landlord."},
{"text": "602 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is a robo-adviser worth the risk? ### Response: The primary risk with one is that it does not build a portfolio that accurately represents your needs and risk tolerance. Some firms base the number of questions they ask you on sign up based not on what is needed to get a good profile, but how many before people decide that it is too much hassle and bail."},
{"text": "603 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is a robo-adviser worth the risk? ### Response: I personally don't think there's a huge risk that the robots will lose all your money, but there's every reason to expect they aren't likely to perform better than traditional managers. They've been around long enough now for there to be past performance figures you can google for. I think you'll find the results aren't very encouraging."},
{"text": "604 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are the ins/outs of writing-off part of one's rent for working at home? ### Response: The IRS regulations for deducting a home office. Be ruthlessly meticulous about the IRS regulations. If it is allowed, it's allowed. If not, don't do it. If you have to do it, you won't get a tax break."},

The usual test for deductions is: was the expense legitimately incurred in the pursuit of revenue? The flexibility permitted will vary by tax authority but you can frequently deduct more than you expected."},
{"text": "606 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are the ins/outs of writing-off part of one's rent for working at home? ### Response: Make sure that you are squeaky clean in all aspects of your tax preparation. Home office deductions are a huge red flag that often trigger audits. Follow mbhunter's advice and be incredibly meticulous about following the rules and keeping records.

{"text": "607 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do I determine if sale proceeds from an asset are taxable? ### Response: If it's fully expensed, it has zero basis. Any sale is taxable, 100%. It's a cap gain, but I believe, as with real estate, special rates apply. This is where I am out of my area of expertise, and as they say - \"Consult a professional.\""},
{"text": "608 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do I determine if sale proceeds from an asset are taxable? ### Response: Profit = Sale price - Basis Basis = Purchase price - any depreciation taken, including expensing it. Basis is the sum of the sale price and the price paid for the property at the time of purchase. Profit is the difference between the sale and the purchase price."},
{"text": "609 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What tax laws apply to Meetup group income? ### Response: In the United States tax law, a group of people who are neither an individual nor an incorporated entity is called \"partnership\" Income derived by such a \"meetup.com\" group is essentially a partnership income with the group members being the partners."},
{"text": "610 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Self employed, putting away tax money ### Response: You need to do some planning to forecast your full year income and tax bill. In general, you should be filing a quarterly form and tax payment. You'll still reconcile the year with an April filing, but if you are looking to save up to pay a huge bill next year, you're looking at the potential of a penalty."},
{"text": "611 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Where on schedule C should a PO Box Rental fee go? ### Response: I never understood why there are so many categories when they are just summed up and subtracted from your income. How can you possibly get in trouble for putting something in a wrong column if the final tax liability doesn't change. Turbotax community had a similar question. They claim you just put it into \"Office Expense\"."},
{"text": "612 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Switching Accountants - who does the audit review for past years? ### Response: Any accountant can help you with audit regardless of who prepared the return. The original accountant would probably be better informed about why you reported each number on the return and how it was calculated. If you kept all the docs, it can be recalculated again."},
{"text": "613 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How much house can I afford, waiting around 3 years or so ### Response: On $4K/mo gross about $1000/mo can go to the mortgage, and at today's rates, that's about $200K of mortgage the bank might lend you.

A computer = money. Yes, the business can count that as a expense but you will need tocount that as income because a computer means money. It's not an expense, it's income."},
{"text": "616 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are the tax implications if I do some work for a company for trade, rather than pay? ### Response: If you receive something in exchange, the value of the item you received would be your income. But what if you don't receive anything in exchange? If the company bought a computer that they loan to you to do occasional work for them, there's no reason you couldn't take the computer home and have that company retain ownership."},
{"text": "617 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: why the currency data(such as USD/JPY) is different from different source ### Response: Some sources will report a close price that averages the bid and ask.

{"text": "619 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Loan to son - how to get it back ### Response: I started a business a few years ago. At one point it wasn't going so well and my father \"loaned\" me an amount not too dissimilar to what you've done. From a personal perspective, the moment I took that loan there was a strain the relationship. I've since helped one of my children. Although I went about it an entirely different way."},
{"text": "620 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Loan to son - how to get it back ### Response: If you feel that your son will be able to consider this without taking it personally, or you're willing to risk that relationship, then talk to him about it. Lay out the reasons why you need the money. If there are other children, it might be a simple matter of fairness to them."},
{"text": "621 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Loan to son - how to get it back ### Response: I think this is a real subjective thing. Financially lets get rid of that line before interest rates get too high. Maybe have him pay you the $200 he is paying towards the interest each month. Seems fair. I think that would be a good idea."},
{"text": "622 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Loan to son - how to get it back ### Response: If you're making minimum monthly payments, you'll still be doing the same thing 25-30 years from now. I was in a somewhat similiar situation as your son, only to the tune of $13,000. When he trades it in for a newer vehicle, I will probably loan him the money and have him make payments to me rather than the bank."},
{"text": "623 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Loan to son - how to get it back ### Response: Your son is foregoing a significantly smaller financial loss in the future in exchange for foregoing his debt completely today. What borrower would not be happy with such arrangement, and what lender would do it?

{"text": "624 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ghana scam and direct deposit scam? ### Response: Of course, it is a scam. Regardless of how the scam might work, you already know that the person on the other end is lying. People in trouble don't contact perfect strangers out of the blue by e-mail for help. Scammers prey on the gullibility, greed, and sometimes generosity of the victims."},
{"text": "625 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ghana scam and direct deposit scam? ### Response: This is a bog-standard 419 scam.  It's probably the most lucrative single swindle in the world. It used to be Nigerian royalty, now it's Ghanaian porn stars. It's always hard to get people to believe they have been tricked, but don't let your dad participate."},
{"text": "626 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ghana scam and direct deposit scam? ### Response: It's difficult to comprehend how you can possibly be scammed if you have no money in your bank account. The $100 bill is counterfeit. If it were not, the person would buy the shoes themselves. It doesn't get any simpler than that."},
{"text": "627 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ghana scam and direct deposit scam? ### Response: Josie Ann Miller is being used as the face and name of scams.

{"text": "629 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ghana scam and direct deposit scam? ### Response: Linda/Josie's initial plan was to have your dad pay money to (supposedly) help her get the gold chest. Once \"she\" found out that he doesn't have any money and/or is apparently not willing to send any, she switched to a different scam. Once the money is irreversibly transferred, the check will bounce. End result: 0 in the account before the transaction, minus a lot afterwards."},
{"text": "630 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ghana scam and direct deposit scam? ### Response: Just because your father has no money doesn't mean he can't be robbed. The scammer is almost surely planning to move some money around. She'll then take off with the money. Your father would be smarter to sit in his back yard and wait for money to fall from the sky."},
{"text": "631 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Ghana scam and direct deposit scam? ### Response: The scammer is definitely up to something fishy. He may deposit some money into your father's account to gain his trust. After which, he will propose to come meet your dad. He will come up with a story about flight, VISA issues, or a problem he has to solve."},
{"text": "632 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can anybody explain the terms “levered beta riders”, “equity long-short” and “the quant process driven discipline” for me, please? ### Response: \"Leveraged beta riders\" are those who take on additional risk [by taking on debt to invest], and invest in a manner that the author would perhaps considered \"blindly\" following Beta. \"Quant process driven discipline\" appears to be positive commentary on investors who use detailed quantitative analysis to develop rules which they rigorously follow."},
{"text": "633 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can anybody explain the terms “levered beta riders”, “equity long-short” and “the quant process driven discipline” for me, please? ### Response: Hedge fund managers that use traditionnal methods to select stocks will have less success than those who use artificial intelligence and computer programs. The use of computer programs and artificial intelligence is THE way to go for hedge fund managers in the future. \"No man is better than a machine, but no machine isbetter than a man with a machine\""},
{"text": "634 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: what would you do with $100K saving?  ### Response: Buying a house to rent out is starting a business. If you want to spend the ongoing time and effort and cash running a business, this can be a reasonable investment. Remember that many, perhaps most, small businesses fail. Nothing produces quick return with low risk."},
{"text": "635 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: what would you do with $100K saving?  ### Response: The real answer is \"Why do you want to waste a windfall chasing quick returns?\" Instead, use this windfall to improve your financial situation, and maybe boost you toward financial independence, or at least a secure retirement. In simplest terms, forget the short term, go for long term."},
{"text": "636 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: what would you do with $100K saving?  ### Response: I would buy an ETF (or maybe a couple) in stable, blue chip companies with a decent yield (~3%) and then I'd play a conservative covered call strategy on the stock selling a new position about once a month. That's just me."},
{"text": "637 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: The formula equivalent of EBITDA for personal finance? ### Response: I personally track my cash flow on a day-by-day basis.

{"text": "639 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's the least risky investment for people in Europe? ### Response: Putting the money in a bank savings account is a reasonably safe investment.

{"text": "640 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do multi-currency bank accounts work? What is the advantage? ### Response: Banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account. It is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency. So One can have an account number say 123456 and have it in say AUD and USD. If you don't quote a currency along with the account number, it would be treated as default currency."},
{"text": "641 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: what is the meaning of allowing FDI in Insurance and pension funds ### Response: The shareholding pattern was that Indian company should have a majority shareholding, any foreign company can have only 26% share's. This limit has now been extended to 49%, so while the control of the private insurance company will still be with Indian's the foreign companies can invest upto 49%. It's a economic policy decission and the outcome whether positive or negative will be known after 10 years."},
{"text": "642 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are “upstream investments” and “downstream investments” in this context? ### Response: Upstream is into businesses that supply the original business; downstream is into companies that make use of the original product. This is also called vertical integration. The upside of vertical integration is that a company is less reliant on suppliers (and intermediate consumers) and has more control over its supply chain."},
{"text": "643 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: I am the sole owner of an LLC. Does it make a difference if I file as an S-Corp or a sole-member LLC? ### Response: S-Corp are taxed very different. Unlike LLC where you just add the profit to your income with S-Corp you have to pay yourself a \"reasonable\" salary. I think the advantage (but don't hold me accountable for this) is if your S- corp makes a lot more than a reasonable salary, then the rest of the money can be passed through on your personal return at a lower rate."},
{"text": "644 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: I am the sole owner of an LLC. Does it make a difference if I file as an S-Corp or a sole-member LLC? ### Response: The question implies that you knew this, but for everyone else's benefit, you can keep you LLC organization and still elect to be treated as a S-Corp by the IRS just for tax purposes. You do this by filing Form 2553 with the IRS. Depending on what you need to pay yourself to meet the \"reasonable salary\" test, this could result in tax savings."},
{"text": "645 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: I am the sole owner of an LLC. Does it make a difference if I file as an S-Corp or a sole-member LLC? ### Response: Your state, which is where the business is legally formed and recognized, creates the LLC or Corporation. \"S-Corp\" doesn't come into play here: your company is either an LLC or a Corporation. If your company was created by the state as a Corporation, you could still elect pass-through taxation."},
{"text": "646 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: I am the sole owner of an LLC. Does it make a difference if I file as an S-Corp or a sole-member LLC? ### Response: With an S-Corp, you pay yourself a salary from company earnings. That portion is taxed at an individual rate. The rest of the company earnings are taxed as a corporation, which often have great tax benefits. If you are making over $80K/year, the difference can be substantial."},
{"text": "647 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do the wealthy pay for things? ### Response: The wealthy people don't use cash if they don't have to. Cash is a tool to them that they use only if they get benefit of it being a cash transaction. For people who \"dislike\" credit cards and pay using ATM or debit cards might actually have a very poor understanding of leverage."},
{"text": "648 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do the wealthy pay for things? ### Response: There's nothing special you need to have to pay a million dollars. You just write a lot of zeroes on your check, but you don't need a special check for that. Large amounts of money are transferred electronically (wire-transfers), which is also something \"regular\" people do once or twice in their lives."},
{"text": "649 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do the wealthy pay for things? ### Response: I was once the personal assistant to two wealthy NYC sisters. They did not pay for anything. For example, if we were riding the subway, I would pay, and be reimbursed by the Company. They had multiple residences and investment properties. Each property was purchased through a separate Limited Liablity Corporation."},
{"text": "650 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: As an employer, how do I start a 401k or traditional IRA plan? ### Response: Here is a nice overview from Vanguard on some options for a small business owner to offer retirement accounts. I would look over the chart and decide which avenue is best for you and then call around to investment companies (Vanguard, Fidelity, etc. etc.) asking for pricing information."},
{"text": "651 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: As an employer, how do I start a 401k or traditional IRA plan? ### Response: You can set up a personal IRA for yourself, but not for employees. As far as setting up a 401(k), I'd suggest checking with benefits management companies. If you're small, you probably don't have an HR department. Outsourcing this to a company which handles HR for you would be the best option."},
{"text": "652 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: As an employer, how do I start a 401k or traditional IRA plan? ### Response: If you are the sole owner, consider the benefits of an individual 401(k) The contribution limits are higher than an IRA, and there are usually no fees involved. Once you have employees, if you want to set up a retirement plan for them, you'll need to switch to a traditional, employer-sponsored 401k."},
{"text": "653 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Acquiring first office clothes ### Response: There is no need to go custom made when you are just starting out. Off-the-rack is good enough for a suit for this stage of your life. You may find you never need more than one or two suits, and they never need to be custom made."},
{"text": "654 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Acquiring first office clothes ### Response: I'm not entirely sure the equivalent exists in your country. But in the US there are thrift stores run by charities like GoodWill or the Salvation Army. It wasn't uncommon for her to find clothes/shoes that retailed for hundreds of dollars for $10 or so."},
{"text": "655 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Acquiring first office clothes ### Response: Our formalwear all looks similar enough that you can get by on a very short rotation. The real key is to just not pick anything flashy and nobody will ever notice. You'll be running to the dry cleaners every single weekend, but you won't have much in terms of up-front costs."},
{"text": "656 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can I import customers and invoices from a previous year's Gnucash file? ### Response: There does not appear to be a way to export the customers and invoices. However, as said in the comments to your question, your question seems predicated upon the notion that it is 'best practice' to create a new data file each year. This is not considered necessary."},
{"text": "657 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: us citizen receiving bank transfer from foreign boyfriend ### Response: No, any gifts you receive are not taxable to you. In fact, losing money in a scam can even be tax-deductible if you lose enough. I wouldn't recommend accepting anything. Usually people with millions are dollars are capable of setting up their own bank accounts."},
{"text": "658 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why does it take 3 days to do electronic transfers between banks? [duplicate] ### Response: It takes some time for a bank user to \"release\" a funds transfer. Once it has been initiated it is put into a queue to be reviewed as potentially fraudulent or money laundering activity. Almost every transaction has to be monitored for this from a legal standpoint."},
{"text": "659 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why does it take 3 days to do electronic transfers between banks? [duplicate] ### Response: Banking systems are typically decades old and subject to innumerable legal and technical restrictions. When Laurence Olivier took the role of Douglas Macarthur in the Unification Church's filming of Inchon, he told the press, \"People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple: Money, dear boy.\""},
{"text": "660 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Swiss-style Monetary Policy ### Response: This is what is called \"weasel words\". They're trying to put some authority into their ad, but since they don't have any - they're putting meaningless words that sound important. Monetary policy is the state/central bank policy to control the supply of the available currency. Cannot think of a way to connect it to private investments."},
{"text": "661 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Swiss-style Monetary Policy ### Response: I'm not sure what is traditionally meant by \"Swiss-style monetary policy\" but lately it has meant the same thing as US monetary policy. Look how many Swiss Francs it takes to buy a currency that cannot be printed:   That hasn't been too stellar lately."},
{"text": "662 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why does capital gains tax apply to long term stock holdings? ### Response: Short term investing is mostly speculation and causes securities to be incorrectly valued. In a perfect market the value of a company should stay the same from yesterday to today. When you hold a stock for a long term you really are investing in the company and saying \"this company will grow\""},
{"text": "663 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why does capital gains tax apply to long term stock holdings? ### Response: Most well-off people have investments which they have held for long periods of time. They also have influence on legislators and officials through various social contacts, lobbyists, and contributions. They managed to convince these law makers to offer a lower tax on income derived from sales of such investments."},
{"text": "664 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why does capital gains tax apply to long term stock holdings? ### Response: Investments that contribute to the economy as a whole and not just the investor are encouraged by the lower tax rates on the profits. The government wants people to make long term investments because that would lead to other long-term government goals. Claiming that long term social goals are somehow bad is hypocrisy."},
{"text": "665 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why does capital gains tax apply to long term stock holdings? ### Response: In Australia we have a 50% capital gain discount if you hold the asset for more than 12 months. The main reason is to encourage people to invest long-term instead of speculating or trading. The government sees speculation or short term trading as more risky than long term investing for the everyday mum and dad investor."},
{"text": "666 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Self Assessment UK - Goods and services for your own use ### Response: If you believe that both of those activities constitutes a 'service rendered in a professional capacity', then you should include it into the 'Goods and services for your own use' field. If you believe those services rendered was not in aprofessional capacity and it was in a personal one, you need not include it in the field. It might be wise to call up the HMRC to clarify on your particular situation."},
{"text": "667 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Self Assessment UK - Goods and services for your own use ### Response: It depends whether it's your business providing the service, or you personally. If you gave your dad a free TV then it would be clear that you have effectively paid yourself with another TV and then given it to your dad as a gift. With services it's less clear whether you're receiving services from the business for free."},
{"text": "668 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Early Retirement Options (UK) ### Response: It's highly unlikely that you will be able to achieve 8% and would consider myself lucky to get 4% in the current interest rate environment. After 18 months of giving it a try, I decided to abandon this strategy. My money will receive better and safer returns in a dividend focused mutual fund."},
{"text": "669 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Early Retirement Options (UK) ### Response: Some people put money into Venture Capital Trusts for the yields they offer. The risks are different and they are considered higher risk than ordinary equities. You need to be a sophisticated investor or high net worth individual to consider them. I'm not recommending these for you, just pointing it out as another option."},
{"text": "670 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Online accounting with Stripe/PayPal transactions ### Response: At the end of each month, I download transaction data from each of Stripe and PayPal. So it is just six entries in Wave per month plus a little spreadsheet manipulation to determine revenues and fees. Takes about 10 minutes to do this. I really dislike Wave's \"automatic\" integration with PayPal."},
{"text": "671 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to handle taxes related to affiliate marketing? ### Response: I know that I have to send form 1099, but I don't know where this   form should go to. Should I send it to the IRS or the affiliate user   or both? There's also form 1096 that you need to send to the taxman."},
{"text": "672 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How does per-annum depreciation for taxes work after the first year of depreciation? ### Response: The first method is the correct one. Assume you depreciate in straight line over 5 years. For computers (except for large mainframes) you get 30% depreciation. In Maryland they do not allow depreciating to $0, but rather down to 25% of the original cost."},
{"text": "673 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to categorize shared income? ### Response: Your company received $1000 from you, and based on its agreement with the other company - transferred out half of it. How does it not translate to having $1000 income and $500 expense? You can write in your reports whatever you want, but if you want to see the real picture, then that is exactly what you should be expecting."},
{"text": "674 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How prudent would it be to invest (stocks/equity) in businesses that are based on Cash transactions? ### Response: CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery.

{"text": "675 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How prudent would it be to invest (stocks/equity) in businesses that are based on Cash transactions? ### Response: Every listed company needs to maintain book of accounts.

{"text": "676 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why buy stock of a company instead of the holding company who has more than 99% of the stocks ### Response: Say the child company is worth 100 million, and the parent is worth 500 million. The child company performs very well, and increases in value by, say, 20 million. As the parent company owns the child, we could say it also increased in value. The difference is proportional - Your investment in the child sees a 20% gain in value, whereas your investment of the parent sees a 4% gain."},
{"text": "677 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why buy stock of a company instead of the holding company who has more than 99% of the stocks ### Response: VW has more brands, i.e. is more diversified This isn't necessarily a good thing for investing. It makes the company less likely to go down, but it limits your portfolio. If you buy VW, you get some Audi but a lot more of the rest of VW."},
{"text": "678 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Do I have to pay taxes in the US if my online store sells to US customers even though I don't live in the US? ### Response: You're not in the US, so there's nothing to effectively connect your income to. You usually are considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business when you perform personal services in the United States. If you form a legal entity in a US jurisdiction - then that entity becomes subjected to that jurisdiction."},
{"text": "679 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is it possible to block previously authorized ACH access? ### Response: The American banking system is very much geared against the consumers, and in many ways is very retarded. You can put stop payment once its processed and try to reverse it claiming fraud, but the end result will be #1. This is one of the reasons I'm reluctant allowing standing ACH authorizations any more."},
{"text": "680 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can a school club collect money using credit cards? ### Response: Large and small universities have procedures in place regarding the use of the universities name, logo, facilities, and budget. They should have in place guidelines regarding the collection and use of funds from members, and participants. These guidelines are what allows you to have an account with the university."},
{"text": "681 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How can a school club collect money using credit cards? ### Response: Many universities will only allow you to accept student organization dues paid in cash, check, or money order. You should check with the Office of Student Affairs (or equivalent) at your University to see if you can accept Credit Cards. Your best bet would be to just use cash."},
{"text": "682 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Advantages of Shareholder over Director in new Company ### Response: The custom in the US is for officers and directors to be indemnified by the corporation. For US corporations (not LLCs), the duty of care (prudence) requires that directors behave responsibly. It usually becomes a court case in the context of a large public company in the midst of an acquisition event."},
{"text": "683 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Advantages of Shareholder over Director in new Company ### Response: The key to being director in a company is the additional responsibility. Legally you can be held in breach. At the same time you will be able to influence your decision much better if you are a director. If you are only a shareholder, you cannot be held responsible for decision by company."},
{"text": "684 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What options are available for a home loan with poor credit but a good rental history? ### Response: The minimum credit score is 580, and you can sometimes even go lower than that. Why not just do an FHA loan? Another alternative is to consider a rent-to-own agreement with his landlord. If he doesn't buy he'd continue renting there anyway."},
{"text": "685 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What options are available for a home loan with poor credit but a good rental history? ### Response: Getting a new job may actually hurt unless it's a substantial increase in income. Banks usually look at salary going back 2 years, and look for consistent, maintainable income. Here are some (not all) things that can help overcome a low credit score."},
{"text": "686 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What options are available for a home loan with poor credit but a good rental history? ### Response: With 6 months living expenses in the bank after paying 20% down on a small house, he should have no issues getting a reasonably priced mortgage. If he waited just a bit longer he might buy the same house outright with cash. When I ran the computations for myself many years ago, it would have taken me half as long to save the money and pay cash."},
{"text": "687 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can I pay estimated taxes based on last year's taxes if I anticipate more income this year? ### Response: If your total tax liability is less than $1000, you can not pay estimates at all, just pay at the tax day. See this safe harbor rule in the IRS publication 17: General rule. Your 2015 tax return must cover all 12 months."},
{"text": "688 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Multi-state K-1 earnings to S-Corp ### Response: I'm not sure why you think that it matters that the distribution goes to an S-Corp vs an individual tax payer. You seem to think it has any relevance to your question, but it doesn't. It only confuses your readers. The situation is like this: LLC X is deriving income in State #2."},
{"text": "689 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Bank statements - should I retain hardcopies for tax or other official purposes (or keep digital scanned copies)? ### Response: In the UK Directgov don't specify anything more than \"records\" Individuals (i.e. not self-employed, or owning a business) need to keep bank statements for between 12 and 15 months after your tax return, depending on when you filed it."},
{"text": "690 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Bank statements - should I retain hardcopies for tax or other official purposes (or keep digital scanned copies)? ### Response: Once the bank gives you a 1099 stating how much interest you have earned, you don't need to keep them. If you only have them in electronic form, that is good enough for the IRS. When you do need to show a bank statement, such as when applying for a loan, the loan company will be keeping a copy."},
{"text": "691 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Bank statements - should I retain hardcopies for tax or other official purposes (or keep digital scanned copies)? ### Response: Be consistent. Digital records are fine, but record-keeping practices are important. Be consistent. Be a good citizen. Be good to your neighbors. Be nice to each other. Be friendly. Be polite. Be kind. Be considerate. Be patient. Be responsible. Be loyal."},
{"text": "692 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Multiple SEO companies claiming I have a past-due invoice ### Response: If they are sending stuff to a Virginia PO Box, close the box with no forwarding address. If they are targetting you personally in New Hampshire, the best thing to do is to sue proactively before it goes to collection. New Hampshire has strict anti-debt-collection laws."},
{"text": "693 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Paid part of my state refund back last year; now must declare the initial amount as income? ### Response: If you get 1099-G for state tax refund, you need to declare it as income only if you took deduction on state taxes in the prior year. If you did itemize, you have to declare the refund as income and deduct the taxes paid last year on your schedule A. If this year you're not itemizing - you lost the tax benefit."},
{"text": "694 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Paid part of my state refund back last year; now must declare the initial amount as income? ### Response: As long as you have good records, you can deduct the excess refund you had to pay back in the year in which you paid it. Whether or not your return was amended shouldn't affect whether or not it is deductible. http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc503.html says you can deducted \"Any prior year's state or local income tax you paid during the year\""},
{"text": "695 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Self Employed, but not required to pay estimated taxes? ### Response: The annualized method allows you to take a look at each quarter independently and pay the tax in the quarter that you earned it.

{"text": "697 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way? ### Response: Employer healthcare is a tax protected expense for employees via section 125 of the tax code. If employee money is being spent at a corporate cafe, it's taxable income being spent. There have been discussions in congress to assess a value as income to employees for services like on site child care."},
{"text": "698 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way? ### Response: In many countries, giving something free to the employee is considered a taxable income equivalent, and taxes have to be paid on it. As it cannot be assigned to specific employees, the company pays a flat tax on it, so it actually costs the company more. Also, not all employees value it equally, or consider it as a part of their income."},
{"text": "699 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way? ### Response: Google would be running a cafeteria that can be subsidized.

{"text": "700 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way? ### Response: Many companies now offer domestic partner health coverage as well, regardless of whether the couple is in any kind of civil union or other arrangement.

{"text": "701 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way? ### Response: The IRS says that in order to avoid lunch being taxed as income, the employees must pay the \"direct costs\" of the lunch, food and labor. In addition to those costs, cafeterias add two more items to come up with the total tab; \"overhead,\" (the cost of renting the space), and of course, profit."},
{"text": "702 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way? ### Response: An employee \"fringe benefit\" is a form of pay other than money for the   performance of services by employees.

One example of taxable fringe benefit is award/prize money."},
{"text": "703 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way? ### Response: A survey suggests new programmers value \"free lunch\", old programmers do not care about it.

{"text": "705 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Taxes due for hobbyist Group Buy ### Response: You do actually have some profits (whatever is left from donations). The way it goes is that you report everything on your Schedule C. Your gross profits will then flow to Net Profit (line 31) since you had no other expenses. From line 31 it will go to your 1040 for the final tax calculation."},
{"text": "706 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: LLC Partnership Earned Income vs. Partnership Share ### Response: You file one K-1 per partner, on which you report the total of income attributed to that partner. There's no variables here, the income you report is the income already earned. How you decide the attribution of income is governed by your operating agreement, the IRS only needs the bottom line."},
{"text": "707 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: LLC Partnership Earned Income vs. Partnership Share ### Response: The TurboTax advice is simplified for entities that don't track interests relative to partner inputs. It would appear that you are not actually \"equal\" partners. You have differently valued interests and those values fluctuate based on individual performance. But note § 704(b)(2), which prevents blatant tax-rigging in the partnership agreement."},
{"text": "708 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What significant negative factors affect Yahoo's valuation? ### Response: There are two very large negative factors that affect Yahoo's valuation. The search business is in decline and continues to lose ground to Google and even Bing. The company can't seem to decide what to do with its stake in Alibaba. There's more to this than meets the eye by using a first-blush look at asset valuation."},
{"text": "709 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do I tell the Canada Revenue Agency that they're sending someone else's documents to my address? ### Response: The Revenue will figure it out.

{"text": "713 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: If I were to get audited, what would I need? ### Response: Keep your originals for a suggested seven years; while the IRS is trying to audit much faster than that.

{"text": "717 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What can I expect to pay when meeting my first financial planner? ### Response: Within some industries there will be that first meeting which is free to see how well do two people work together. There is also the possibility that the planner is compensated by the products you purchase through him. While this does present a conflict of interest, you have to decide whether you want a fee-only planner."},
{"text": "718 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What can I expect to pay when meeting my first financial planner? ### Response: A complete analysis of your current situation, goals, and formulating a plan to meet those goals, including discussing your risk tolerance cannot be completed during the initial meeting. You could inquire a few days before the meeting what information he needs from you. This would also be a good time to ask about fee structure. What fee that is expected for the initial analysis can vary greatly."},
{"text": "719 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to systematically find sideways stocks? ### Response: You can likely use bollinger band values to programmatically recognize sideways trending stocks. Bollinger band averages expand during periods of volatility and then converge on the matched prices the longer there is little volatility in the asset prices. Also, look at the bollingers band formula to see if you can glean how that indicator does it, so that you can create something more custom fit."},
{"text": "720 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Who Can I Hire To Calculate the Value of An Estate? ### Response: A good estate attorney would hire a forensic accountant to trace the accounts. Since there's no will - it will probably require a lawyer as well to gain access to all the accounts the accountant discovers. I would start with a good estate lawyer, who in turn will hire a Forensic accountant."},
{"text": "721 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Will the ex-homeowner still owe money after a foreclosure? ### Response: Bankruptcy will wipe out the shortfall, and most other debts, but the downside is that most of the rest of your assets will also be sold to help pay off what you owe. Details of what you can keep vary from state to state. If you want to go this route, hire a lawyer."},
{"text": "722 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Will the ex-homeowner still owe money after a foreclosure? ### Response: In non-recourse states, the bank has no recourse beyond the repossession of the property. As for the question about what price the bank can sell it: again, each state makes its own rules. States may have rules against selling it for much below market value."},
{"text": "723 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Will the ex-homeowner still owe money after a foreclosure? ### Response: Banks have to discount the value of loans to take into account the likelihood of the loan not being repaid. They classify certain loans as riskier than others, and these are discounted more heavily. An unsecured home loan to a customer that has already defaulted, has no collateral, and now needs to pay rent AND loan repayments would count as an extremely risky loan."},
{"text": "724 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is it ok to just report to 1 credit bureau instead of all 3 ### Response: It is cheaper to report to more agencies than to query more agencies. Each agency calculates the score independently based on the information reported to that agency. Only reporting a negative item to Experian will mean that TransUnion and Equifax scores for the same person will be higher."},
{"text": "725 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why do stocks track the price of Oil?  ### Response: Just because the price of petroleum is high doesn't mean investors are going to buy shares of an electric car company. The price of company \"X\" shares are determined by supply and demand. A strong economy may be somewhat correlated with oil prices and a strong market, but it's not necessarily the case that strong oil prices drive the economy."},
{"text": "726 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: (Almost) no credit unions in New York City, why? ### Response: There are 2 credit unions in the Metro NY area that are open to everyone. You might also want to check out aSmarterChoice.org to see if there are other credit union options based on where you live, work, worship & more."},
{"text": "727 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: (Almost) no credit unions in New York City, why? ### Response: The growth rate in credit union market share is higher in New York than it is in California. While there is no question that bankers hate credit unions, I can't tell you why credit unions have a smaller market share in NY. Maybe the regulatory environment is part of it. Banks have a big lobby and they pay a lot of taxes in NYC."},
{"text": "728 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: The Intelligent Investor: Northern Pacific Railway example ### Response: Investors were blinded by a small dividend, without considering the actual value of the company. Some investors may undervalue share return that does not come in the form of a dividend. This may or may not be legitimate, because if the company reinvests its profits in poorer performing projects, the investors would have been better off getting the dividend."},
{"text": "729 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: The Intelligent Investor: Northern Pacific Railway example ### Response: Graham was a great believer in the theory that management should pay out \"most\" of its earnings in dividends. He believed that by holding dividends so far below earnings, the company was either being \"stingy,\" or signalling that the $10 a share of earnings was unsustainable."},
{"text": "730 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: The Intelligent Investor: Northern Pacific Railway example ### Response: Two of the main ways that investors benefit financially from a stock are dividends and increases in the price of the stock. In the example, the benefits came primarily from dividends, leaving less benefits to be realized in terms of an increase in the value of the company."},
{"text": "731 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why is a home loan (mortgage) cheaper than gold loan? ### Response: In the past Loan against GOLD was considered priority sector lending [Loans to poor and agriculture etc]. Every Bank need to lead around 25% to priority sector. Many Banks gave loans relatively cheaper to todays rate rather than giving it as Farm loan that almost never get recovered."},
{"text": "732 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why is a home loan (mortgage) cheaper than gold loan? ### Response: Lending money secured by gold is inherently riskier than a loan secure by your home. Increased risk means the lender must charge more. That's why home loans are cheap compared to loans for other purposes. Home loans are secured by the house. Houses are assets that hold and usually retain some value."},
{"text": "733 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Is human interaction required to open a discount brokerage account? ### Response: You do not need human interaction to open an account at Schwab. You just need to provide a social security number and US drivers license. You can do it online or through the mail. They usually have some questions about your level of experience with investing."},
{"text": "734 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Transfering money from NRE account in India to family member ### Response: I want to transfer some amount 10 lakhs+ to my brother from my NRE account in India to his account. Is there any illegality here doing such transaction? No. Please ensure proper paper work to show this as loan and document the money trail. Once I get my money in NRO account do I need to pay taxes in India on the money he deposited? This question does not arise."},
{"text": "735 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: If you are at the median of middle income families in the US that might mean $70,000/year. 15% of that is an investment of $875 per month. If you invest that amount monthly and assume a 6% return, then you will have a million dollars at approximately 57 years old."},
{"text": "736 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: This spreadsheet presumes that you only make $50,000/year, never get a raise, that your savings earns 6% per year and that the market never has a crash like 2008. You can change this simple model with any other assumptions you wish to make and model. I recommend the book Engineering Your Retirement as it has more detailed models and goes into more details."},
{"text": "737 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: If my calculations are correct, in the above scenario, at age 80, you would have more than a billion in the bank, after taxes. Millionaire, Shmillionaire! Let's do this calculation Bruno Mars style (I wanna be a Billionaire...)"},
{"text": "738 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of the S&P 500 over the last 35 years has been about 11%. You may earn less than the assumed 9%, depending on how the stock market does. If you stick with your 15% investment amount throughout your whole career, you'll most likely end up with more."},
{"text": "739 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: If you have $0 and want $1M at retirement, you will need to put away $524.20/month, or $6,290.40/year, which is 15% of $41,936. You can calculate your own figures with a financial calculator."},
{"text": "740 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: If you would keep your current income for the rest of your life, here is approximately how things would turn out after 40 years: All interest is calculated relative to the amount in your portfolio. At 12% this would over 40 years get you almost 1 million dollar. If you just follow gradual growth, you would need to get quite lucky to reach a million."},
{"text": "741 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: Based on 15% of a salary of $550 per month with various annual raises: Broadly speaking, this investment doubles the value of the contributions over two decades. Rebalancing fees are not included in the simulation. Notice above how the bond index (VBMFX) preserves value during the 2008 crash. This illustrates the rationale for diversifying across different fund types."},
{"text": "742 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: In 1968 my parents bought a house for £8000. They had a mortgage on it for about 75% of the value. They don't live there but that house is now valued at about £750,000. If you invest in property in a market like the UK then insane house price inflation will do it for you."},
{"text": "743 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: The article says if you can follow this simple recipe throughout your working career, you will almost certainly beat out most professional investors. The group of people who do put away a substantial fraction of their (lower) early wages and keep them invested for decades show (at least) two traits that will make a very substantial difference to the average (western) person."},
{"text": "744 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: At present the exchange rate is 107 Pakistani rupees per US dollar so even with this exchange rate, to have a million US dollars means having 107 million rupees of wealth. Now with this maths in mind you can very well calculate how much possible it is for an average 25 years old Pakistani to have that much wealth."},
{"text": "745 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: Money invested for longer earns more interest, and the sooner you start investing, the longer it has to earn interest. These ideas come out of pension investment where 65 is the usual retirement age. What you invest in the 1st ten years of your pension accounts for over 50% of what you will get out."},
{"text": "746 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire? ### Response: From January 1966 to January 1992 the real annual return was just 4.1%. This does not matter so much if you are investing all the way through, but it's still a 26 year period. Saving 50% is totally possible. I know people saving 65%."},
{"text": "747 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can a Zelle Bank Transfer be reversed or denied after credit has been added? ### Response: After collecting information via web searching, the comments above, and a additional call to BOA, i have concluded the following to the best of my knowledge. Zelle Transfers are final. As Jay mentioned above, funds are subtracted from the sending account before the transfer is made, therefore it eliminates sending funds that do not exist."},
{"text": "748 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Setting up a LLC for two partners in different states, what should we look into? ### Response: Get a tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State) for tax issues, and a lawyer for the Operating Agreement, labor law and contract related issues. LLC, by default, is a pass-through entity and all income will flow to your respective tax returns. Your employee couldn't care less about your tax problems."},
{"text": "749 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are the procedures or forms for a private loan with the sale of a vehicle? ### Response: The Nebraska DMV web site has a neat page about this. It seems to be fairly simple, and not costly to record a lien and later release it. Just go there with the title and the sales agreement that details the terms and pay the $7 fee."},
{"text": "750 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What are the procedures or forms for a private loan with the sale of a vehicle? ### Response: Draft up a promissory notes. Have a lawyer do it use one of those online contract places if you have simple needs.  Your promissary note need to cover Be specific. There are probably a lot more items that can be included, and if a quick internet search is any indication it gets deep fast."},
{"text": "751 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What is the point of owning a stock without dividends if it cannot be resold? ### Response: Shares often come associated with a set of rights, such as ability to vote in the outcome of the company. If there were any liquidity events due to demand of the shares, this is typically at a much higher price than the shares are now when the company is private/closely held."},
{"text": "752 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What is the point of owning a stock without dividends if it cannot be resold? ### Response: If the stock will NEVER pay dividends and you will NEVER be able to sell it, it sounds to me like this is a worthless piece of paper. It all depends on how likely it is that the situation will change. If the investment is small, maybe it's worth it."},
{"text": "753 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Does setting up a company for your own improves credibility? ### Response: The key here is that you are defacto running your own company no matter if you acknowledge it or not. In the end these questions have the goal of deciding if you can and will repay the loan. Running your freelancing as a business has advantages of being able to deduct normal expenses for running the business from your revenue."},
{"text": "754 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to account for startup costs for an LLC from personal money? ### Response: You give a loan to the company from yourself as a private person, and when the company makes money the company pays it back to you. Even if you don't want a business account yet, you can probably ask your bank for a second account (mine in the UK did that without any problems)"},
{"text": "755 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to account for startup costs for an LLC from personal money? ### Response: You don't even need to formally loan the LLC any money. You pay for the setup costs out of pocket, and then once the LLC is formed, you reimburse yourself. Essentially you submit an expense report to the LLC for the startup costs, and the LLC pays out a check to you."},
{"text": "756 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to account for startup costs for an LLC from personal money? ### Response: Use two Equity accounts, something like \"Capital Contributions\" and \"Capital Distributions\" When you write a personal check to the company, the money goes into the company's checking account. When the company has enough retained earnings to pay you back, you use the Capital Distributions equity account and just write yourself a check."},
{"text": "757 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to account for startup costs for an LLC from personal money? ### Response: How do I account for this in the bookkeeping? Here is an example below: This is how you would accurately depict contributions made by an owner for a business. If you would want to remove money from your company, or pay yourself back, this would be called withdrawals. It would be the inverse of the first journal entry."},
{"text": "758 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to account for startup costs for an LLC from personal money? ### Response: If a single-member LLC does not elect to be treated as a corporation, the LLC is a \"disregarded entity\" If the owner is an individual, the activities of the LLC will generally be reflected on: Form 1040 Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business (Sole Proprietorship)"},
{"text": "759 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How to account for startup costs for an LLC from personal money? ### Response: An LLC is a pass-through entity in the USA, so profits and losses flow through to the individual's taxes. An LLC has a separate TIN but the pass- through property greatly simplifies tax filings, as compared to the complicated filings required by C-corps."},
{"text": "760 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What should I do with my freshly opened LLC in California after I've moved? ### Response: There's no reason to keep the California LLC if you don't intend to do business in California. If you'll have sales in California then you'll need to keep it and file taxes accordingly. You can just as easily form a new LLC in Washington state and even keep the same name."},
{"text": "761 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why don't banks print their own paper money / bank notes?  ### Response: There was a system of \"subscriptions\" between banks in the 19th century. Large banks backed the smaller banks to some extent. Problems came to a head during the Panic of 1907. The subsequent creation of the Federal Reserve was a response to that crisis."},
{"text": "762 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why don't banks print their own paper money / bank notes?  ### Response: In the UK the Bank of England and Bank of Scotland print the money. In some other countries (like Hong Kong, Israel, and the US) commercial banks were issuing the currency at some point of time, but now the governments do that. The problem with commercial banks issuing currency is the control."},
{"text": "763 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why don't banks print their own paper money / bank notes?  ### Response: In Scotland, each bank issues its own separate notes. It's not uncommon to see identical-valued £10 notes from three different banks in one's wallet. The Scottish National Bank is the largest bank in the country, issuing £1billion worth of notes each year."},
{"text": "764 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why don't banks print their own paper money / bank notes?  ### Response: Are you talking about printing up more of the same kind of bill, or printing up a different type of bill? You'll have different answers based on which one you mean. Governments don't like competition in this matter. In US history there are examples of the government shutting alternative currencies down."},
{"text": "765 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why don't banks print their own paper money / bank notes?  ### Response: There is absolutely no logical reason why each nation does not own and control banking. Banking depends solely on the confidence of the customers/investors. When a sovereign nation/state has ownership of the banks, the profits are kept in-house, within the nation."},
{"text": "766 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why don't banks print their own paper money / bank notes?  ### Response: Any person at any time may produce their own currency, one can even do so on the back of a paper napkin, ripped beer coaster or whatever. This is NOT a banking privilege, it is within the lawful ability of anyone capable of engaging in commerce. A 'negotiable instrument' gives the holder rights to a sum of money."},
{"text": "767 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why don't banks print their own paper money / bank notes?  ### Response: In the US, it's backed by 3$ per every 100$ promised, that's the magic of \"fractional reserve banking\" Banks do issue their own money, just not embodied as a piece of paper. It's called checkbook money."},
{"text": "768 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should I use an NRE or NRO account to transfer money from India to the US? Any reports needed? ### Response: Deposits into NRE account can only be done from funds outside India. So your brother cannot deposit into your Nre account. He can deposit in NRO account or directly wire transfer the funds. Both these require some paper work depending on the amount."},
{"text": "769 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Should I use an NRE or NRO account to transfer money from India to the US? Any reports needed? ### Response: NRE is a tax free account, exempt from income tax. NRE account is freely repatriable (Principal and interest earned) while the NRO account has restricted repatriability. NRO is a restricted repatriable account, while NRE is free."},
{"text": "770 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's the point of a chargeback when they just ask the merchant whether they owe money to the buyer? ### Response: When you initiate a chargeback, the merchant has the right to dispute the chargeback. A chargeback is a powerful tool, but it is not a magic button that makes a charge disappear. You should go to the merchant first, if you can, and ask for a refund."},
{"text": "771 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's the point of a chargeback when they just ask the merchant whether they owe money to the buyer? ### Response: I strongly urge all consumers who are considering doing a chargeback to try to work with the merchant first, and use the CC dispute as a last resort. In general, you can think of the credit card dispute department like a judge. They hear the arguments presented by both sides, and consider them to the best of their ability."},
{"text": "772 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's the point of a chargeback when they just ask the merchant whether they owe money to the buyer? ### Response: The point of a chargeback is to force merchants to do the paperwork. Many merchants don't, and are easy targets for chargebacks. You used a tax prep service. They may have given you poor (technical) advice, but such firms are usually very good about doing the paperwork, that's why you lost."},
{"text": "773 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What's the point of a chargeback when they just ask the merchant whether they owe money to the buyer? ### Response: You may be using the wrong method to get your money back. Many cards have various kinds of guarantees, one of which might cover this situation. In some european countries, such as the United Kingdom which has Section 75 allowing you a recourse, services are included with goods."},
{"text": "774 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Corporate Equity Draw vs Income ### Response: You are tagged with S-Corp, so I assume that you have that tax status. Under that situation, you don't get taxed on distributions regardless of what you call them. If you also work for the small business, then you need to pay yourself a reasonable wage."},
{"text": "775 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: What happens if a bank no longer use an intermediary bank?  ### Response: If your counterparty sent money to a correspondent account at another bank, then it is completely up to the other bank what to do with the money. If the wire transfer completed, then the account is not closed. For this reason, you should be avoid any situation where you are wiring money to anyone except the intended recipient."},
{"text": "776 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How quickly will the funds be available when depositing credit card checks? ### Response: Credit card checks are blank checks that your credit card company sends you. It is entirely up to bank policy how long they will make you wait to use these funds. If your teller doesn't know the answer, you'll need to find someone at the bank who does."},
{"text": "777 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment? ### Response: The advice your father passed on to you is nonsense, plain and simple. Use a free service, first, AnnualCreditReport.com to get a copy of your credit report. Then a service like Credit Karma for a simulated FICO score and advice on how to improve it."},
{"text": "778 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment? ### Response: FICO's website identifies \"payment history\" as 35% of your FICO score. The first thing any lender wants to know is whether you’ve paid past credit accounts on time. Credit lines (a category which includes credit cards) with no late payments is a factor."},
{"text": "779 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment? ### Response: Credit card debt can be paid back in full when you get the bill, or you can \"take a loan\" and \"pay in installments\". If you do the latter, and pay back at least the minimum required amount on time, you are not \"missing\" your payment. A \"first-time offender\" won't always be reported to the credit bureau, but if he is, it won't be a positive report."},
{"text": "780 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment? ### Response: All credit accounts are \"real\" from the day you open them. The bureaus only store on your file what gets reported to them by the institution who extended you the credit. The institution won't report it until the 30-day mark at the earliest."},
{"text": "781 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment? ### Response: Of course credit cards are viewed as credit. If you have unpaid money on your card this is debt - plain and simple. When you apply for a mortgage any unpaid credit (debt) is considered and would adversely affect you if you have such debts. The level to which it affects you depends on the amount of debt."},
{"text": "782 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment? ### Response: There's a difference between missing a payment and \"carrying a balance\" Mortgage brokers claim that carrying a small balance here and there on a credit card may improve your score. If you instead actually miss a payment, or make a payment that's less than the minimum payment, that will almost certainly hurt your credit score."},
{"text": "783 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment? ### Response: Think of it as a very short term line of credit. Not clearing the balance within three months (or turning it over) demonstrates a cash flow problem, as does clearing it from another card. If you use the credit and show you can pay it off, you should never need to ask for a credit increase."},
{"text": "784 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Who buys variable annuities? ### Response:  annuities are not the best deal around (and are often ripoffs) Keep in mind that any \"guarantees\" offered are guarantees made by an insurance company. The only backing up of that claim in the event of a company failing is protection from your state's Guaranty Association."},
{"text": "785 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Who buys variable annuities? ### Response: There is always some fine print, read it. I doubt there is any product out there that can guarantee an 8% return. A 70 yr old can get 6% in a fixed immediate annuity. On death, the original premium is retained by the insurance company."},
{"text": "786 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Who buys variable annuities? ### Response: For 99% of us, variable annuities are a raw deal for everyone except the person selling them. Two types of people: (1) Suckers (2) People who feel that investment advisors/brokers make too little money."},
{"text": "787 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Who buys variable annuities? ### Response: Three-quarters of US states protect variable annuity assets from creditors. Regular IRA's don't benefit from protection under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. As always, you should consult a legal/tax professional to see if this might be a good option for you to consider."},
{"text": "788 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why does AAPL trade at such low multiples? ### Response: Last quarter results were very well received because of the somewhat dramatic increase in service revenue indicating that maybe the company can shift from relying so heavily on the iPhone. As it stands, Apple is a single product company and that hinders long term prospects, hence the relatively low multiple."},
{"text": "789 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Why does AAPL trade at such low multiples? ### Response: Apple hasn't released anything more than incremental upgrades to its existing product lines since Steve Jobs passed. Whether you like or hate Apple, you had to admire Jobs' passion and creativity. There's real question as to whether the company can sustain its dominance in the market without the Jobs vision."},
{"text": "790 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Can the Standard Deduction still apply to a Traditional IRA early withdrawal? ### Response: IRA distributions are reported on line 15b on the standard form 1040. That is in the same Income section as most of your other income. The Personal Exemption (calculated on 6d, subtracted from the total in line 42) and the Standard Deduction are later reduced to arrive at Line 43, \"Taxable Income\""},
{"text": "791 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: US tax - effectively connected income ### Response: ECI is relevant to non-resident aliens who are engaged in trade or business in the US. For that, you have to be present in US, to begin with, or to own a business or property in US. So the people to whom it is relevant are non- resident aliens in US or business/property owners."},
{"text": "792 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: My wife and I are selling a house worth $230k-$260k. Its a rental. Should we use an agent, limited service listing agent, or FSBO? ### Response: If your market is hot enough, FSBO may make sense as you won't need the marketing power and expertise of an agent.

{"text": "881 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: Any reason to keep around my account with my old, 'big' bank? ### Response: Keep a bank account open simply for some reward/loyalty points may just be changing your behavior for the wrong reasons.

How can I get money back besides cashier's check? ### Response: I'd suggest you contact the Office of the Controller of Currency, who regulates BOA and file a complaint.

{"text": "920 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How long do credit cards keep working after you disappear? ### Response: If this is the real problem, incorporate a non-profit corporation or have a lawyer set up a foundation.

{"text": "931 Below is an instruction that describes a task. ### Instruction: How do I handle taxes on a very large “gift” from my employers? ### Response: The IRS will look at all the facts and circumstances to make a claim, but my guess would be that the initial claim would be for this to be taxable income for your husband.

(India) ### Response: In the US banks, and more friendly institutions such as credit unions, use to offer the option of a 'secured' credit card.
